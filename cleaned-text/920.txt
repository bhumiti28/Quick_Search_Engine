application small devices java jdk divided set modules make lightweight also allows us develop modular applications information click interface private methods java create private methods inside interface interface allows us declare private methods help share common code nonabstract methods before java creating private methods inside interface cause compile time error information click trywith resources java introduced trywithresource feature java helps close resource automatically used words say dont need close resources file connection network etc explicitly trywithresource close automatically using autoclosable interface java trywithresources limitation requires resource declare locally within block information click anonymous classes improvement java introduced new feature allows us use diamond operator anonymous classes using diamond anonymous classes allowed java java long inferred type denotable use diamond operator create anonymous inner class information click java
