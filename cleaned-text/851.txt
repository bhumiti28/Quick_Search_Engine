people many reasons lets look team developers rust proves quite useful team developers low level programming code contains bugs need extensive testing testers however case rust compiler refuses compile code program contains bugs working parallel compiler developer focus programs logic rather focusing bugs students using rust many people learn develop operating system rust team trying make system concepts accessible ordinary people especially new programming companies large small companies use rust accomplish various tasks tasks include command line tools web services devops tooling embedded devices audio video analysis transcoding cryptocurrencies bioinformatics search engines internet things applications machine learning even significant parts firefox web browser open source
