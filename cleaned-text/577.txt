multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types motion everything world naturally continuous state movement specifically earth seems stable state however also somewhat motion state makes clear everything present earth also motion even though dont experience particular objects movement motion concerning something someone typically notice different objects move different ways therefore different types motion primarily based nature movement article discussing common types motion definitions before discuss various motion types let us first briefly understand definition motion including related terms used define motion what motion motion defined change objects position respect time technically object universe motion even universe continual motion motion slow fast motion always however object rest moving call stationary when say object motion always said concerning object instance see person walking road say person motion case person generally moving respect stationary objects trees poles etc besides see person sleeping bed say person rest state motion person stationary respect bed objects around know earth motion technically everything motion examples explained also clarify object rest motion different states times motion mainly defined using following terms distance total measured length path traveled object displacement shortest difference initial position final position moving object speed rate position object changes respect origin time time total duration period object traveling moving all quantities help describing change position objects particular points some general examples motion following general life examples motion help us understand motion clearly humans regular activities running walking jumping many others include motion all activities change state human body when breathe flow air goes lungs flow air also example motion air particles movement vehicles also example motion birds flying sky also motion various everydaylife examples motion let us understand different types motion help us distinguish motion types different categories types motion different particles usually different movement styles sometimes particle may follow different styles instance object may move straight path circular path follow random path according different paths ways movements motion classified different type linear motion rotary motion oscillatory motion periodic motion what linear motion motion linear parts object move one place another particular time important note object moves along perfectly circular path objects motion linear linear motion many significant applications field robotic automation manufacturing etc high use type motion seen linear actuators some common examples linear motion include followings motion train track motion vehicles road motion falling apple tree etc linear motion classified following two types rectilinear motion when object linear motion moves towards straight lines path objects motion called rectilinear motion vehicle moving straight road train moving straightline track examples rectilinear motion curvilinear motion when object linear motion moves along curved path objects motion called curvilinear motion vehicle taking turn object threw angle examples curvilinear motion what rotatory motion rotatory motion refers type motion different particles object move circular path travel different distances specific time intervals rotatory motion object typically moves rotates axis also sometimes referred rotational motion rotary motion like linear actuators rotary actuators also widespread seen electric hydraulic pneumatic options earth constantly rotating axis around sun best generallife example rotatory motion other common examples include followings rotating fan steering wheel car swinging wheels vehicles around axis what oscillatory motion oscillatory motion refers type motion object moves oscillates around mean position means object repeats cycle motion around mean position more specifically motion object moves like front back oscillation repeatedly certain time intervals oscillatory motion sometimes also known oscillating motion movement object termed oscillations motion pendulum wall clock best example oscillatory motion particular pendulum repeats motion specific period without actually displacing position although somewhat stationary oscillatory motion some common examples type motion include followings table fan wallfan swinging around different directions left right release air form oscillatory motion when child single swing pushed swing moves fro mean position making oscillatory motion both linear actuators rotatory actuators oscillatory motion sound waves travel oscillatory motion strings guitars sitars move fro around mean position strummed movement strings oscillatory motion what periodic motion periodic motion refers type motion objects typically repeats equal time intervals some examples objects undergoing periodic motion include bouncing ball moving swing water waves rocking chair etc apart motions repeat called nonperiodic may fall motion types instance birds gliding across sky birds motion nonperiodic may usually fall linear motion category examples may one type motion nothing wrong object one type motion possible let us look examples understand possible earth earth rotates axis rotational motion earth also repeats motion around sun circular path particular intervals one year therefore also periodic motion technically earth two different types motion time ceiling fan consider entire ceiling fan whole rotational motion rotates axis besides consider outer parts blades blades periodic motion keep following circular path regular intervals bicycle consider bicycle moving straight road case wheels bicycle rotate around axis rotational motion furthermore bicycle moving forward straight road also rectilinear motion sewing machine sewing machine includes wheel rotates around axis motion sewing machine rotational motion moreover needle continually moves operate sewing machine needle sewing machine periodic motion therefore sewing machine two different types motion rotational periodic motion some classifications motion apart types mentioned also distinguish motions according directions state motion classification motion according directions mainly three types motion depending directions one dimensional motion when object moves along straight line objects motion known onedimensional motion two dimensional motion when object moves along curved path plane objects motion known twodimensional d motion three dimensional motion when object moves randomly space objects motion known threedimensional d motion classifications motion according state mainly two types motion depending state motion uniform motion when object motion travels equal distance equal timeperiods graph drawn time distance straight line type motion object called uniform motionfor example earths rotation revolution nonuniform motion when object motion travels unequal distance equal timeperiods objects motion known nonuniform motion nonuniform motion graph drawn time distance usually curved line also known accelerated motionfor example freely falling object next topictypes resistors prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest
