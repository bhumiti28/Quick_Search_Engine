discuss following topics what ssis what data integration why ssis how ssis works requirements sql server integration service what ssis package ssis tasks example data flow task example execute sql task what ssis ssis stands sql server integration services component available microsoft sql server database software used perform wide range integration tasks data warehousing tool used data extraction loading data another database transformations cleaning aggregating merging data etc ssis tool also contains graphical tools window wizards workflow functions sending email messages ftp operations data sources ssis used perform wide range transformation integration tasks whole ssis tool used data migration ssis tool mainly used perform two functionalities data integration ssis performs data integration combining data multiple sources provides unified data users workflow workflow used perform several things sometimes need execute specific steps particular path either based time period parameter passed package data queried database used automate maintenance sql server databases provides update multidimensional analytical data what data integration data integration process follow integrate data multiple sources data either heterogeneous data homogeneous data data structured semistructured unstructured data integration data different dissimilar data sources integrate form meaningful data some methods used achieve data integration data modelling data modelling need first create data model perform operations data profiling data profiling process used check errors inconsistency variations available data data profiling ensures data quality data quality refers accuracy consistency completeness data advantages data integration reduce data complexity reduces data complexity means data delivered system data integration maintains complexity streamlined connections making easy deliver data system data integrity data integrity plays major role data integration deals cleansing validating data everyone wants high quality robust data achieve data integration concept used data integration helpful removing errors inconsistency duplication easy data collaboration accessibility comes data collaboration accessibility means data easily transformed people easily integrate data projects share results keep data uptodate smarter business decisions also provides make smarter decisions integrated data refers transmit process within company understand information easily integrated data much easier informative why ssis ssis used following reasons data loaded parallel many varied destinations ssis used combine data multiple data sources generate single structure unified view basically responsible collecting data extracting data multiple data sources merging single data source removes need hard core programmers sssis platform capability load large amount data excel sql server database integration products sssis tool provides tight integration products microsoft cheaper etl tools sssis tool cheaper tools resist base products manageability business intelligence etc complex error handling within dataflows sssis allows handle complex error within dataflow you start stop dataflow based severity error you even send email admin error occurs when error resolved pick path workflow how ssis works we know ssis platform two functions ie data integration workflow both tasks data transformations workflow creation carried using ssis package ssis package consists three components operational data operational data database used integrate data multiple data sources perform additional operations data place data housed current operation sending data warehouse storing reporting archiving etl etl important process ssis tool etl used extract transform load data data warehouse etl process responsible pulling data multiple data sources transforming data useful data storing data data warehouse data format xml file flat file database file also ensures data stored data warehouse relevant accurate high quality useful business users easily accessed data warehouse used effectively efficiently also helps organization make datadriven decisions retrieving structured unstructured data multiple data sources etl threeword concept divided four phases capture capture phase also known extract phase phase picks source data metadata data format xml file flat file database file scrub phase original data checked checks data whether consists errors checks errors inconsistency data using artificial intelligence techniques short verifies whether quality product met transform third phase etl transformation process original format converted required format want transformation modelling changing data according user requirements changes either change number columns rows load index fourth phase load index loads data validates number rows processed once loading data completed indexing used indexing helps track number rows loaded data warehouse indexing also helps identify data whether correct format data warehouse data warehouse single complete consistent store data formulated combining data multiple data sources difference database data warehouse answer yes well both database data warehouse large unit data similar physical representation response time complex queries data warehouse faster database requirements sql server integration services following requirements install sql server integration services install sql server install sql server data tools follow steps install sql server data tools step click link httpsdocsmicrosoftcomenussqlssdtpreviousreleasesofsqlserverdatatoolsssdtandssdtbiview sqlserver download sql server data tools step when click link screen appears shown screen select version ssdt want install step once downloading completed run downloaded file when run downloaded file screen appears shown step click next button step select visual studio instance tools want install visual studio step click install button what ssis package package fundamental block code ssis here code mean coding programming language means development development done ssis package ssis mainly used etl process etl process performed inside ssis package ssis package composed three parts connections ssis package connections connections used connect various data sources control flow elements ssis package composed two elements ie control flow elements data flow elements control flow elements handle workflows workflow means performing tasks steps sequence done control flow data flow elements data flow elements perform transformations ssis tasks ssis package add tasks task unit work different types tasks perform different kinds work various types tasks discuss common tasks used ssis execute sql task used execute sql statements relational database data flow task mainly used read data one multiple data sources transform data also load data one destinations analysis services processing task used process objects ssas cube tabular model execute package task task used call packages within project you even pass variable values called package execute process task allows run application batch scripts sql server integration services used open standard application microsoft excel microsoft word etc also used unzip compressed file file system task used perform manipulations file system moving files deleting files renaming files changing directory etc ftp tasks iftp tasks used perform operations files folders example want send receive file ftp server local directory ssis ftp task used script task task allows write net code want perform send mail task task used send email mainly used want notify users regarding state task whether running state error occurred lets see working example data integration service example data flow task step first create excel file microsoft excel suppose i create student database microsoft excel fields student table studentid studentname marks gender step open visual studio sql server data tools step click file option move new project step when click project screen appears shown screen click integration services appearing leftmost side panel click integration services project step after clicking integration services project option screen appears shown screen consists five tabs control flow data flow parameters event handler package explorer we already discussed control flow data flow control flow data flow exist inside ssis package step import data need first create database create table sql server database know student data available inside excel file want import data sql server database order achieve need first create table sql server open sql server management studio step create student database rightclick database click new database option step enter database name screenshot i given studentwarehouse database name step click ok button step now create table studentwarehouse database rightclick tables click new table step now add fields table studentid studentname marks gender we set studentid primary key uniquely identifies row screen shows add four fields table after adding fields table save table providing useful name suppose i provided student table name step move back visual studio control flow contains data flow task drag drop data flow task main window step when doubleclick data flow task control automatically moves data flow control flow say control flow container data flow step now perform transformations data flow we want extract data excel file created earlier drag drop excel source sources appearing leftmost side panel from screen observe red cross appears inside excel source means component configured excel source step configure component rightclick excel source click edit option shown screenshot step fill details shown screenshot step after entering details screen appears shown step click excel souce screen shows two arrows red blue arrow blue arrow defines actual data receive excel file red arrow denotes errors now perform transformations performing transformations need load database step load database click other destinations click destination step after adding destination connect source destination step step noticed red cross ado net destination means configured component rightclick ado net destination click edit option shown screenshot step you need specify configuration manager step click new button add connection manager when click new button screen appears shown step add server name select database name sql server step click ok button step add table name want load data step screen map field input source field destination source step after adding mapping source connected destination shown screenshot step click start button run integration
