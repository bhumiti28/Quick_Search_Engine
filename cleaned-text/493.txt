question where spend time do spend time writing code course lot time experienced developer spends thinking big picture design software review code refactor old code fix bug read code developers spend time learning new library frameworks needed job short write less code spend time thinking good software design mean good software software making plan build spent time industry deep better know perfect software good enough depending deadlines sometimes spend time optimizing things sometimes refactoring code fixing bug created junior developers end matter youre always focused building perfect software much possible within given deadline difference writing code software writing code good software when exhibit quality developer writes code good software might followed best practices engineering principles coding standards guidelines given senior developers today blog talk guidelines essential learning every junior developer course want become great engineer engineer guidelines help build good software perform better job before go ahead keep mind one thing software never perfect wont get perfect license create garbage missing ingredient reluctance quantify quality boris beizer clever optimization code readability discussed developers spend time reading code writing most time need debug application check commits done developers reading building new feature need add software take care code readability pay attention writing code easy understand easy modify even need write longer variable function names writing lines code completely acceptable easy understand modify example declare variable name distanceinmeters instead distance variable name makes sense even requires bit extra typing you wont spend time looking around codebase find unit distance variable lot developers write one solution codebase avoid adding extra lines code optimize code sometimes becomes difficult understand coders solution might bit difficult developers understand oneliner solutions kinds optimizations useful youre sole contributor project avoid adding codebase multiple contributors code revision ask developer let know revision control saved multiple times something went wrong codebase matter whether youre sole contributor small project youre working multiple developers big project revision control become essential tool use enterprises before working new feature adding code codebase make sure take code revision first who commits done deleted added updated etc short keep track changes keeping track various stages development helps resolve issues development application application doesnt behave expected code breaks go back stable version application find whats causing problem revision control also allows developers work project simultaneously without disrupting stable version already released users git popular one svn cvs version control mercurial lot version controls available work project verify validate application you spend several days working application keep adding features application finally shipped how would feel listen product doesnt meet specific requirement you need major changes application doesnt meet customers expectations issue common software development doing major changes application also frustrating thing developers avoid issue verify validate application throughout various stages development iterations ship product small releases instead one bigger release do ship product end everything done verification make good practice evaluate verify product different stages development check application meets specified requirement check aligned design specifications validation sometimes developers misunderstand product specification requirement focus building product later product gets shipped hear issues users software doesnt meet requirements built expected issue common software development avoid issue validate software validate determine product meets users expectations product built per requirement both processes single goalyour software aligned features proposed originally ensure thing experienced developers follow v model software development lifecycle v model developed experts shows verification validation happen different stages software development v model helpful identifying unnecessary requirements below quick diagram v model understand processes better way code refactoring tdd bugthe important part every developers life how fix bug code know hate testers find lot bugs code you might using different techniques tools approaches fix bug code one best ways fix bug code tdd introduced kent beck american software engineer lets take look steps given understand idea process tdd software development when youre going various stages iterations development come tests could possibly break code apply tests code check test breaks code code breaks need come solution fix code write enough code fix code doesnt break try different test once come solution specific test code fixes specific test test code your code needs corrected least one test fails move code refactoring code passes tests once youre done step refactor code basically refactoring remove unnecessary thing code make code organizable you improve overall structure code without affecting external behavior functionality application after refactoring repeat process unless youre finished break cases comments project documentation your code selfexplanatory fewer comments add comments wherever important add unnecessary comments also make sure update comments whenever make changes code lot programmers neglect thing comments code refactor code comments need explain code works also understand code alone always enough explain chose specific approach solve problem cases comments helpful describe coming project documentation part essential describe code relevant users documentations helpful users developers want contribute code readme file one best ways document project when user interacts project first time file helps understanding everything project explain project list dependencies provide detailed instruction work project final note we list many tips perform better job software developer software developer collaborate developers especially senior engineers let know mistakes show right path dont get hesitated ask help need being software developer sitting hours
