protein synthesis next prev peroxisome peroxisome microbody two types microbodies include peroxisomes glyoxysomes peroxisomes single membrane bound structures similar lysosomes structure function term microbodies introduced rhodin peroxisome discovered christian de duve coworkers however seen first time rodin liver cells kidney cells named peroxisome due formation hydrogen peroxide inside peroxisomes found eukaryotic cells plant cells invertebrates found paramecium number peroxisomes per cell number size peroxisomes vary cell cell depending type cell environmental conditions example bakers yeast small number peroxisomes found glucose supplied yeast hand peroxisomes bakers yeast given long chain fatty acids source carbon similarly peroxisomes liver kidney cell origin peroxisome originates endoplasmic reticulum er extensions er bud form vesicles called peroxisomal precursor vesicles precursor vesicles take enzymes nutrients cytosol thus become peroxisomes peroxisomes may increase size divide two enough amount protein phospholipid material receive cytosol endoplasmic reticulum structure peroxisome single membrane bounded cell organelle may spherical oval shape its diameter ranges micrometre membrane lipid bilayer like plasma membrane its main role formation breakdown hydrogen peroxide besides crystalline core urate oxidase present centre crystalline form how peroxisome work during metabolism break proteins along useful products various harmful substances also formed urea uric acid access amino acids peroxisomes allow harmful substances move two types enzymes one oxidase another one catalase oxidase peroxidase enzymes include damino acid oxidase alpha hydroxy acid oxidase beta hydroxy acid oxidase peroxisome performs oxidation uric acid urea etc presence oxidase enzyme forms hydrogen peroxide hydrocarbon released process oxidase enzyme removes hydrogen substances adds oxygen form hydrogen peroxide example rh o r h o r organic substrate hydrogen peroxide good cell due corrosive effect so required removed immediately second enzyme catalase converts hydrogen peroxide water oxygen nontoxic substances thus cell protected example h o h o o so degrades reactive oxygen species ros damage cell ros oxygen ions peroxides produced byproduct normal cellular reactions due tobacco radiations drugs ross cause oxidative stress damage dna molecules made lipids like cell membranes antioxidants also used prevent also carries breakdown fatty acid like oil molecules produce energy besides like lysosomes peroxisomes also contain enzymes however unlike lysosome mainly breaks proteins peroxisome mostly breaks long fatty acids process called lipid catabolism functions peroxisomes responsible removing toxic substances body convert uric acid amino acid hydrogen peroxide change hydrogen peroxide oxygen water protect cells harmful effects hydrogen peroxide detoxifies alcohol drugs liver removing hydrogen alcohol adding oxygen plants photorespiration occurs peroxisomes present plant cells presence oxygen converts fatty acids smaller molecules involved lipid metabolism betaoxidation fatty acids biosynthesis cholesterol synthesis steroid hormone etc also take part catabolism damino acids bile acids polyamines peroxisomes present green leaves aid photosynthesis carry photorespiration along chloroplasts supports germination seeds converts stored fatty acids carbohydrates thus provides energy raw materials growth germinating plants also contains enzymes make plasmalogens important component membrane brain heart tissues peroxisomes fireflies contain luciferase enzyme aid bioluminescence thus helps fireflies find mate helps synthesis phospholipids needed cell membrane contain oxidising enzymes aid process gluconeogenesis formation glucose animal cells leaves take part photorespiration involved oxidation glycolates formed chloroplast photosynthesis breaks hydrogen peroxide h o formed photorespiration water oxygen help catalase protects cell toxic effect hydrogen peroxide enzyme urate oxidase take part catabolism amino acids polyamines purines nitrogenous bases found nucleic acids like dna rna next
