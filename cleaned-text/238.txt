everything becoming digital here newest promising digital payment system come market cryptocurrency topic understand exactly cryptocurrency different types cryptocurrencies advantages disadvantages cryptocurrency definition cryptocurrency also known crypto type online payment method exchanged online purchase goods services much similar realworld currency physical appearance encrypted transparent decentralized digital money based blockchain technology approximately different types cryptocurrencies among bitcoin ethereum popular ones cryptocurrency digital virtual currency transparent decentralized secured cryptography important feature cryptocurrency decentralized currency decentralized means issued central authorities user owns neither government bank controls also known money future bitcoin first decentralized cryptocurrency released opensource software year after creation bitcoin several cryptocurrencies created cryptocurrency various features limit many units exist bitcoin million limits performs easy verification transfer funds help hashing algorithms verify transaction independent central authority bank new units added certain conditions met what blockchain blockchain technology used bitcoin cryptocurrencies type record maintaining system multiple users run decentralized manner when bitcoin exchanged network block data created shared entire network once block verified added previous blocks forms chain type hence known blockchain advantages cryptocurrency last several years cryptocurrencies popular among public several advantages paper money some advantages given fraudproof one important advantages cryptocurrency fraudproof when cryptocurrency created users confirmed transactions saved public ledger identity coin owners kept encrypted hence chance fraudulent transaction user ownership since cryptocurrency decentralized user owns government bank control also electronic cash system easy transaction traditional economy system type business deal always lot transaction fees applicable need pay transaction apart also various paper works brokerage fees commissions etc users need pay use cryptocurrency things removed transaction middle man every transaction performed one one within secured network onetoone transaction makes easier transparent traditional one confidential transactions when perform transaction traditional transaction system either cash credit transaction recorded bank history means transaction data remains banks cryptocurrency every transaction recipients would unique information exchanged basis push concept means allowed share information want disclose recipients instant settlement easy use cryptocurrency making popular among people starting transaction need smart device mobile phone internet connection instantly become bank make online payments transactions identity theft cryptocurrency ensured ledger transactions performed digital wallets calculate accurate balance public ledger also known transaction blockchain blockchain technology makes secure digital transactions encryption smart contracts make entity virtually unhackable immune fraud how cryptocurrency works cryptocurrencies decentralized systems work blockchain technology cryptocurrency medium exchange digital encrypted decentralized unlike currencies us dollar euro central authority involves manages maintains value cryptocurrency instead managing maintaining tasks broadly distributed among cryptocurrencys users via internet working phenomenon cryptocurrency transaction given one user sender wants send funds another user starts transaction transaction represented block block forwarded blockchain network block validated users chain verified valid transaction block added chain each transaction encrypted contains unique set keys whoever set keys amount cryptocurrency note working cryptocurrency explained respect bitcoin cryptocurrencies may differ functioning dont use blockchain technology what crypto cryptocurrency crypto used cryptography technique encryption decryption secure communication two parties cryptography technology usually uses computational algorithm sha public key private key public key shared everyone private key like digital signature user general bitcoin transaction occurs steps first step user transaction details means bitcoin needs shared much transaction passed hashing algorithm validate transaction bitcoin sha hashing algorithm used output hashing algorithm goes signature algorithm users private key uniquely identifies user output step distributed network people verify transaction transaction verified using senders public key verify known minors after verification bitcoin added blockchain cannot reversed types cryptocurrency after creation bitcoin various types cryptocurrencies available market below list popular types cryptocurrencies bitcoin bitcoin recognizable type cryptocurrency system per studies approximately million bitcoin tokens available circulation capped limit million bitcoin cash bitcoin cash introduced year one popular types cryptocurrencies available market litecoin litecoin gaining popularity day day works bitcoin developed charlie leeformer employee google year ethereum etherum heard context bitcoin cryptocurrency instead online programmable platform uses blockchain technology helps developer develop run daapps within system ethereum understood app store ripple ripple also type cryptocurrency use blockchain technology particular user rather mainly works large companies corporations move huge amount money across world stellar stellar open network mainly used store transfer money designed way financial systems across world work together network allows create send trade possible digital forms money whether dollar pesos bitcoin anything charge users use network neo neo formally called antshares created china its main goal towards smart contracts enable users create execute agreements without involving intermediary cardano cardano ada type cryptocurrency used sending receiving digital funds created charles hoskinson coin available scientific philosophy researchdriven approach means reviewed scientists programmers iota iota stands internet things application launched year main difference iota blockchain technologies iota work blocks chains rather works smart devices internet things use need verify two previous transactions iota ledger known directed acyclic graphdag also known tangle what cryptocurrency mining cryptocurrency mining means validation transaction since cryptocurrency works decentralized network doesnt central authority validate task anyone network minor successful minor gets new cryptocurrency reward minors need find hash product cryptographic function connects new block predecessor minor reward given miner finds solution complex hashing puzzle first once minor gets solution build block add blockchain setup mining rig users need either gpu applicationspecific integrated circuit how buy cryptocurrencies two ways buy cryptocurrency either us dollars another cryptocurrency means cryptocurrencies including bitcoins purchased using us dollars others purchased using cryptocurrencies purchase user needs online app contain currency digital wallet generally user creates account exchange transfer real money buy cryptocurrencies risks investing cryptocurrency some advantageous features cryptocurrency also become risky investing three major risks given operates without government authority discussed works decentralized way hence contain central authority government role fact raises many questions type taxes paid gain loss assets so main risk investing cryptocurrency physical existence cryptocurrency virtual currency hence physical existence neither represents company like stock bond tangible asset like gold printed papers similar currencies hence fundamental value trading value volatile nature last risk factor cryptocurrency volatile nature prices crypto vary irregularly may sometimes get reduced increased hour contrast currencies limited variation future scope cryptocurrency per current growth rate easily seen cryptocurrency great scope upcoming years also conflicts occur accepting cryptocurrency part economy easily seen top cryptocurrencies play important role future gaining popularity daybyday past
