process vs thread difference between process thread javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev process vs thread difference between process thread difference process thread one widely asked questions technical interviews both processes threads related much similar hence create confusion understand differences process thread independent sequence execution differentiated way processes execute different memory spaces whereas threads process execute shared memory space topic understand brief introduction processes threads differences what process process instance program executed when run program execute directly takes time follow steps required execute program following execution steps known process process create processes perform multiple tasks time created processes known clone child process main process known parent process each process contains memory space share processes known active entity typical process remains form memory process os remain following states new new process created ready process ready waiting allocated processor running program executed waiting waiting event happen occur terminated execution finished how processes work when start executing program processor begins process takes following steps firstly program loaded computers memory binary code translation program requires memory os resources run resources registers program counter stack resources provided os register instruction storage address data required process program counter maintains track program sequence stack information active subroutines computer program program may different instances instance running program knowns individual process features process each time create process need make separate system call process os fork function creates process each process exists within address memory space each process independent treated isolated process os processes need ipc interprocess communication order communicate proper synchronization processes required what thread thread subset process also known lightweight process process one thread threads managed independently scheduler all threads within one process interrelated threads common information data segment code segment files etc shared peer threads contains registers stack counter how thread work discussed thread subprocess execution unit within process process contain single thread multiple threads thread works follows when process starts os assigns memory resources each thread within process shares memory resources process threads mainly used improve processing application reality single thread executed time due fast context switching threads gives illusion threads running parallelly single thread executes process known singlethreaded multiple threads execute simultaneously known multithreading types threads two types threads user level thread name suggests userlevel threads managed users kernel information faster easy create manage kernel takes threads single process handles one process userlevel threads implemented userlevel libraries system calls kernellevel thread kernellevel threads handled operating system managed kernel threads slower userlevel threads context information managed kernel create implement kernellevel thread need make system call features thread threads share data memory resources files etc peer threads within process one system call capable creating one thread each thread stack register threads directly communicate share address space threads need synchronized order avoid unexpected scenarios key differences between process thread process independent contained within another process whereas threads logically contained within process processes heavily weighted whereas threads lightweighted process exist individually contains memory resources whereas thread cannot individual existence proper synchronization processes required contrast threads need synchronized order avoid unexpected scenarios processes communicate using interprocess communication contrast threads directly communicate share address space difference table between process thread process thread process instance program executed processed thread segment process lightweight process managed scheduler independently processes independent hence dont share memory resources threads interdependent share memory each process treated new process operating system operating system takes userlevel threads single process one process gets blocked operating system process continue execution userlevel thread gets blocked peer threads also get blocked os takes single process context switching two processes takes much time heavy compared thread context switching threads fast lightweight data segment code segment process independent threads share data segment code segment peer threads hence threads also operating system takes time terminate process threads terminated little time new process creation time taking new process takes resources thread needs less time creation next topicdifference prev next videos join our
