snow pellets hail article going discuss precipitation types process examples what precipitation formation solid solution known precipitation precipitation liquid solid water droplets come clouds fall ground included drizzle ice crystals fog wind snow pellets hail water vapor condenses produces tiny water droplets air reaches freezing point also known condensation point dew point example precipitation occurs mass humid moist air collides mass cold air condensation moisture condenses droplets become rain crystals droplets become large stay suspended air fall earth precipitation process precipitation atmosphere moisture occurs water vapor condenses larger larger water droplets when drops high sink ground water droplets freeze form ice cloud colder higher altitudes depending clouds temperature earths surface ice crystals fall earth hail rain snow most rain starts snow high sky when snowflakes fall warm air turn raindrops dust smoke particles atmosphere required precipitation particles also known condensation nuclei enable surface water vapor condense helps water droplets collect grow large enough fall ground precipitation still freshwater particularly though water comes ocean its salt sea evaporate time however pollutants atmosphere may pollute water droplets hit earth cases precipitation arising called acid rain acid rain doesnt directly affect humans make lakes rivers acidic plants animals also adapt acidity affects aquatic environments examples precipitation water cycle precipitation plays major role one allows freshwater deposited earth various examples precipitation given follows rain hail snow drizzle sleet freezing rain diamond dust snow grains rain rain would form liquid droplets any evaporate moving layer dry air whenever raindrops fall high altitude clouds times hitting earth dropping raindrops evaporate rain known virga opposite strong downpour dense cloud cover lower air moist raindrops large frequent form rainfall second form rainfall usually regular sleet ice pellets raindrops fall sky freeze reaching ground hail hail appears clouds cold storms forms coldwater droplets freeze solidify contact dust soil hailstones pelt upper portion cloud rain pours before falls frozen water droplets transferred hailstone unlike sleet forms freezes falls earth liquid hail falls like solid ice block hailstones usually small size may grow larger cm diameter weigh pound snow type precipitation falls form ice crystals hail also frost hailstones series frozen water droplets snow complex structure ice crystals formed separately clouds fall stay together snowflakes comparison hail storm snowfall normally calm hailstones tough snowflakes gentle drizzle drizzle light rainfall its thicker fog less shower mist thin fog condenses near ground fog formed ice crystals cloud water droplets suspended air near earths surface drizzle droplets less millimeters inches diameter low stratocumulus clouds form sometimes evaporate reaching earth small scale drizzle persistent cold ambient temperatures sleet form precipitation consists combination rain snow its type frozen rain forms rain falls ground passes layer extremely cold air when violent vertical currents form atmosphere sleet may quickly transform hailstorms sleet frequently experienced thunderstorms generally followed frosty ice particles white deposits mixture semisolid rain cloudy snow strike ground solid surfaces ice pellets sleet bounce fall harsh hitting sound freezing rain freezing rain occurs rain falls freezing temperature conditions usually results solidification rain droplets when raindrops move atmospheres subfreezing layer become supercooled freeze hit earth normal experience even coating ice vehicles sidewalks trees power lines freezing rain resulting layer ice called glaze may buildup thickness centimeters freezing rains significant threat regular activity road transport aircraft power lines diamond dust tiny ice crystal generally formed low temperatures c low levels sparkling effect produced light reflects ice crystals air gave rise name diamond dust snow grains tiny white opaque grain ice snow grains snow grains fairly smooth usually less mm diameter almost equate scale drizzle types precipitation three types precipitation follows orographic precipitation convectional precipitation cyclonic frontal precipitation orographic precipitation precipitation occurs humid warm air hits orographic barrier mountain range atmosphere pushed rise due initial impetus moistureladen air increases condensation forms saturation happens rapidly excess moisture falls orographic precipitation windward slopes convectional precipitation convectional precipitation happens suns energy heats earths surface allowing water evaporate form water vapor when earth heats air warms well consequence air expands rises condensation mechanism creates clouds high atmosphere cyclonic frontal precipitation cyclonic frontal precipitation happens warm cold air collide since warm air lighter cold air rises rising air cooled point saturation resulting heavy rainfall type rain lasts hours noted tropical cyclones bring lot rain next topicsublimation definition
