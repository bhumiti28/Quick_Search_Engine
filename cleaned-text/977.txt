cloud computing platform provides wide variety services use without purchasing arranging hardware enables fast development solutions provides resources complete tasks may achievable onpremises environment azure services like compute storage network application services allow us put effort building great solutions without worrying assembly physical infrastructure tutorial covers fundamentals azure provide us idea azure key services likely required know start developing solutions after completing tutorial crack job interviews able get different microsoft azure certifications what azure microsoft azure growing set cloud computing services created microsoft hosts existing applications streamline development new application also enhances onpremises applications helps organizations building testing deploying managing applications services microsoftmanaged data centers azure services compute services includes microsoft azure cloud services azure virtual machines azure website azure mobile services processes data cloud help powerful processors data services service used store data cloud scaled according requirements includes microsoft azure storage blob queue table azure file services azure sql database redis cache application services includes services help us build operate application like azure active directory service bus connecting distributed systems hdinsight processing big data azure scheduler azure media services network services helps connect cloud onpremises infrastructure includes virtual networks azure content delivery network azure traffic manager how azure works essential understand internal workings azure design applications azure effectively high availability data residency resilience etc microsoft azure completely based concept virtualization so similar virtualized data center also contains racks each rack separate power unit network switch also rack integrated software called fabriccontroller fabriccontroller distributed application responsible managing monitoring servers within rack case server failure fabriccontroller recognizes recovers each fabriccontroller turn connected piece software called orchestrator orchestrator includes webservices rest api create update delete resources when request made user either using powershell azure portal first go orchestrator fundamentally three things authenticate user authorize user ie check whether user allowed requested task look database availability space based resources pass request appropriate azure fabric controller execute request combinations racks form cluster we multiple clusters within data center multiple data centers within availability zone multiple availability zones within region multiple regions within geography geographies discrete market typically contains two regions preserves data residency compliance boundaries azure regions region collection data centers deployed within defined perimeter interconnected dedicated regional lowlatency network azure covers global regions cloud provider offers scalability needed bring applications users closer around world globally available regions around world due availability many regions helps preserving data residency offers comprehensive compliance flexible options customers availability zones physically separated location within azure region each one made one data centers independent configuration azure pricing one main reasons learn microsoft azure because microsoft providing free credits azure account access azure services free short duration credit sufficient people new microsoft azure want use services microsoft offers payasyougo approach helps organizations serve needs typically cloud services charged based usage flexible pricing option helps upscaling downscaling architecture per requirements azure certification microsoft azure helps fill gap industry requirement resource available microsoft provides azure certification three major categories azure administrator those implement monitor maintain microsoft azure solutions including major services azure developer those design build test maintain cloud solutions applications services partnering cloud solution architects cloud dbas cloud administrators clients implement solutions azure solution architect those expertise compute network storage security design solutions run azure all
