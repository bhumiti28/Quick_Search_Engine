groovy library enables soapui provide groovy scripting language users thirdparty api thirdparty api used create customized test automation frameworks properties test requested properties files used hold dynamically generated data test property also used configuration ssl security configurations test requests soapui runner used run soapui project test report soapui generates junit test style report user reporting utility report test results soapui released soapui crossplatform languageindependent first released eviware september sourceforge later acquired smartbear first version release downloaded times soapui software licensed software terms european union public license purely based java platform uses swing user interface run latest operating systems including mac linux windows furthermore crosspltform behavior supports eclipse idea netbeans some protocols technologies following essential protocols technologies used soapui soap stands simple object access protocol rest stands representational state transfer wsdl stands web services definition language http stands hyper text transmission protocol https stands hyper text transmission protocol secured amf stands action message format jms stands java messaging services jdbc stands java database connectivity advantages soapui provides simple userfriendly graphical user interface gui crossplatform desktopbased application supports standard protocols technologies http https amf jdbc soap wsdl etc soapui costs less test tools available market also used message broadcasting provides fast wellorganized framework generates lots web services tests creates mocks testers test real applications supports drag drops features access script development transferring data one response source different api calls without manual interaction soapui tool facilitates tester developer teams work together soapui tool provides facility get data various sources web service without developing code disadvantages soapui security testing requires enhancements mock response module enhances simplified takes longer request big data dual tasks test web services soapui testing following different types testing soapui tools functional testing powerful innovative features validate functional behavioral tests web services applications lets discuss features soapui supports follows provides userdefined scripts customized per requirement testing dragdrop supports drag drops features create run complex test scenarios multi environment support supports multienvironment switch various environments like qa dev prod environment test coverage soapui allows testers dynamically analyze soap rest service covered functional testing data driven testing soapui allows tester debug develop datadriven tests load testing load testing used analyze web service web apis behavior based specific tasks load generally load test used soapui test performance assessments web services load stress endurance nonfunctional testing types lets discuss features soapui supports follows ease use using simple user interface handling loadui agents soapui tools makes load testing easy simple loadui agents soapui contains number loadui agents analyze distribution performance various parameters performance monitoring soapui efficient advanced reporting system collecting test results various performance parameters load testing security testing security testing important tool used ensure authentication authorization web services web api using request response model soapui lets discuss features soapui supports follows crosssite scripting crosssite scripting security test scans detects potential risks specific parameters structured messages security database name suggests security database detects scans potential sql injections may damage database stack overflow used soapui web testing tool scan locate massive documents within xml messages cause stack overflow compliance testing compliance testing consists source data authentication license certificate various service agreements validate web service web api furthermore data authentication certificates test scripts call compliance testing soapui tool check last received message associated wsdl wadl schema definition regression testing regression testing functional testing used soapui tool analyze bugs malfunctions web service also reverifies web
