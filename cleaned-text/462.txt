difference longitudinal transverse waves javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference longitudinal transverse waves we studied many kinds waves physics lectures like sound waves frequency waves etc waves longitudinal transverse waves important topics discussing today so without ado let us begin longitudinal waves defined waves capable displacing medium particular direction move either direction waves opposite longitudinal mechanical waves known compressional waves mechanical waves produce lot compression pressure traveling medium waves also called pressure waves increase decrease pressure traveling sound waves like vibrations pwaves created earthquakes etc kinds longitudinal waves longitudinal waves medium waves parallel longitudinal waves also called lwaves important note abbreviation completely different meaning electrocardiography seismology seismology lwave stands love waves reason people chose call lwave however particular mention abbreviations still used people convenience kind terminology also seen sciencefiction books said earlier sound waves part longitudinal waves so calculate wavelength frequency waves following formula used yx y cos w xc formula mentioned y depicted displacement x distance wave traveled t stands time y periodic variable c stands speed w frequency wave important note speed sound wave depends upon temperature pressure type composition medium medium important aspect shows wave traveled pressure waves another kind longitudinal wave pressure waves seen cases velocity completely dependent upon density material formula mentioned used calculating pressure waves well longitudinal waves also include plasma waves plasma waves defined waves interconnected particles move particular direction three main kinds longitudinal waves ie seismic waves earthquake volcano sound waves ultrasound waves waves move parallel direction waves travel longitudinal waves commonly seen pushing pulling strings when push pull strings waves force applied parallel one another thus longitudinal waves move parallel direction concept longitudinal waves comes one kind wave ie transverse waves transverse wave defined wave moves perpendicular direction one important examples transverse waves includes waves created drums beating membrane drum moves perpendicular surface another example transverse wave light light creates magnetic electric fields depict medium way direction light transverse waves mostly present solids profound elasticity cases deformation material wave called shear wave seismic terms kinds waves also called swaves secondary waves oscillations transverse waves occur direction waves mathematical formulation transverse waves mathematics easiest type transverse wave called linearly polarized sinusoidal also called plane wave unchanging direction traveling some examples transverse waves include ripples water surface guitar strings electromagnetic waves like light waves radio waves microwaves swaves secondary waves interesting note transverse waves travel medium high low densities process called rarefaction compression according rarefactions compression seen transverse waves travel solids thus transverse waves perpendicular one another travel solid objects having discussed terms separately let us see difference longitudinal transverse waves sno longitudinal waves transverse waves longitudinal waves waves travel either direction opposite hand transverse waves waves travel perpendicular direction longitudinal waves present onedimensional objects transverse waves present twodimensional objects longitudinal wave polarized transverse wave polarized aligned longitudinal waves travel gas liquid solid objects transverse waves travel solids longitudinal waves created process rarefactions compression hand transverse waves created troughs crests longitudinal waves move parallel direction transverse waves travel perpendicular direction key points regarding longitudinal transverse waves both waves distinctive features one important topics physics longitudinal waves transverse waves main difference direction longitudinal waves three types whereas transverse waves two types thus longitudinal transverse waves important sense next topicdifference
