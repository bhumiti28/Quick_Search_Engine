multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev solder solder term used soldering process acts filler material two workpieces generally metals joined solder creates strong bond two workpieces soldering inexpensive method compared welding brazing all three terms used fuse two workpieces solder form wire shown here discuss soldering kit process remove solder types solder composition blends solder materials soldering kit lets discuss soldering kit soldering kit comprises solder material acts filler soldering iron soldering station needed variable temperature control solder stand required place hot soldering iron use wet sponge cleaning soldering iron tip solder wick used remove solder components rosin flux used clean metal surface required material workpieces soldering done hence say solder wick type copper wire coated rosin flux used remove solder components workpieces lets discuss process remove solder today modern solder comes builtin rosin flux require external rosin flux cleaning automatically breaks oxides surface metal process remove solder te removing solder component also known desoldering circuit board components difficult remove change solder present desoldering process helps us remove component circuit boards easily process remove solder listed switch power supply activate soldering iron attached soldering station adjust temperature help temperature knob soldering iron heated specified temperature place wire solder wick component want remove solder clean soldering iron place heated soldering iron centre solder wick placed component solder flow wick thus process used remove solder desired component case unable remove solder reapply solder component follow process discussed types solder solder categorized hard solder soft solder depending temperature requirements common soldering process requires temperature degrees celsius large projects hightemperature soldering also used melting point solder required less melting point workpieces higher temperature solder weaken bond two workpieces joined soft solder temperature soft solder less degrees celsius specified temperature range upto degrees standard requirement soldering process temperature higher termed hard solder hard solder temperature requirement hard solder degrees celsius hard solder commonly preferred brazing used jewellery making requires red heat melt here red heat signifies metal heated till turns red strong heating composition solder solder made metal melts heated soldering iron cools applied components composition refers materials made categorized lead based lead free flux lets discuss detail leadbased leadbased solders contain lead tin composition solder percentage contribution tin weight higher percentage tin provides added strength solder united states use lead prohibited due toxic nature note lead harm human soil air water paint dust damages kidney immune system human beings applications soldering plumbing use lead replaced metals advantages leadbased solder include low temperatures better quality toxic nature made poisonous substance health human beings hence leadfree solders replaced leadbased solders lead free leadfree solder solders composition lead tin percentage increased lead replaced metals solver antimony leadfree solder composition comprises metals copper tin bismuth antimony zinc etc combination tin silver copper used hand soldering wave soldering applications order add compatibility solder addition fourth element recently discovered fourth element zinc manganese flux flux used break formation oxide surface metals adds mechanical strength points contact flux categorized active flux passive flux active flux includes strong acids used applications plumbing passive flux contains rosin generally used electronics due environmental concerns use rosin flux replaced watersoluble flux watersoluble flux easy remove detergents purified water deionized water removal flux soldering essential solder blends various types solder available different composition metals lets discuss role additive components alloys alloys combination one one metal lets discuss role various metals effect additives solder material copper copper improves wetting potential liquid maintain contact solid surface property melted solder also forms intermetallic compounds zinc zinc inexpensive material low melting point corrosive nature suitable applications requires flux prevent oxidation corrosion commonly used solder alloys zinc composition zinccadmium zinc tinlead etc tin discussed tin main composition solder alloys higher percentage tin adds strength solder also lowers melting point solder some parts need joined cannot resist higher temperatures hence lowtemperature solder used join parts antimony antimony helps increasing strength solder disturb wettability solder indium indium improves ductility ability material easily stretched wires solder silver silver adds mechanical strength solder combination copper zinc alloy material solder used brazing addition silver also provides corrosion resistance joints addition certain materials silver cadmium lead toxic next topictypes thermometer
