differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference plant tissue animal tissue plants animals prized possessions received nature plants animals important parts nature today many species plants animals become extinct due us we harmed nature certain ways convenience instance many trees cut construction metro several cities now let us discuss plant tissue animal tissue certain differences plant tissue animal tissue both different certain aspects like cell walls tissue organization etc let us look fundamental differences plant tissue animal tissue sno plant tissue animal tissue many dead supportive tissues plant cells compared living tissues animals living tissues compared dead tissues plant tissues require little energy maintenance animal tissues require energy compared plant tissues two kinds tissues plants ie permanent tissues meristematic tissues hand four kinds animal tissues ie muscle tissue epithelial tissue connective tissue nervous tissue meristematic tissues required assisting plant growth plant grows help tissue animals growth tissues reparative growth plants easier tissue organization tissue organization animals quite complex plant tissues cell wall animal tissues cell walls permanent tissues meristematic tissue observed differently plants hand differentiation tissues so key differences plant tissue animal tissue now let us discuss plant animal tissues detail well plant tissue defined group similar cells performing function plant tissues help plants creating organs like stems flowers roots etc plant tissues divided two categories ie meristematic tissue permanent tissue meristematic tissue results plant growth cells tissue grow asymmetrically every plant cell originates meristematic tissue hand permanent tissue divided simple complex tissue permanent simple plant tissue thin called epidermis epidermis guard cells regulate amount air water leaves parenchyma another tissue plant responsible undertaking process photosynthesis permanent complex plant tissue xylem phloem tissues present plants both tissues responsible regulating amount food nutrients also carrying sugar roots stems animal tissues classified four categories let us discuss detail epithelial tissue internal external organs animals epithelial tissues tissues responsible protection secretion absorption etc four kinds epithelial tissues ie squamous epithelial tissue stratified epithelial tissue cubical epithelial tissue columnar epithelial tissue muscle tissue muscles animal body made tissues tissues responsible movement body ie contraction relaxation muscles three types muscle tissues smooth muscle tissues cardiac muscle tissues skeletal muscle tissues connective tissue connective tissues collection different tissues link organs tissues together apart connecting linking tissues tissues also responsible transporting substances among organs six types connective tissues ie areolar tissue adipose tissue lymph blood cartilage bone nervous tissue nervous tissues made neurons neuroglia nervous tissues responsible travel electrochemical impulses so categories plant animal tissues plants animal tissues different unique sense plant tissues animal tissues certain differences already mentioned interesting note certain passages food nutrients water air supplied plants animals passages thus plant tissues animal tissues different sense next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube
