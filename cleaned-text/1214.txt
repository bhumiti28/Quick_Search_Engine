feature gitlab vs github gitlab also devops tool like github git repository hosting service provides issue tracking wikis cicd pipeline combined practices continuous integration delivery opensource free distributed mit license similar github case functionality considered better choice teamwork lets see key differences gitlab github github gitlab launched git repository hosting service launched project alternative available git repository hosting service free public repositories paid private repositories free private public repositories gists way share code snippets gists we cannot attach file issue we attach file issue fast interface comparatively slow interface github decide read write access user repository gitlab set modify user permissions according roles largest repository hosting service contains approximate million repositories lesser projects github bitbucket vs github bitbucket also webbased version control system owned atlassian contains source code allows us share among developers offers free accounts commercial accounts paid provides unlimited number repositories free accounts limitations free accounts like private repository maximum five users bitbucket launched support mercurial projects atlassian acquired also started support git much similar github however one considered best every service different feel targets different demographics matter youre going get excellent service get work done lets see similarities differences bitbucket github github bitbucket userfriendly fast interface slick clean interface provides professional view limited git repository limited git also supports version control systems like mercurial support svn facilitates graphs pulse contributors commits code frequency members assists rest apis build thirdparty applications used development language free public repositories paid private repositories free private public repositories maximum five members private repository github comes lot features allows create workflows bitbucket provides builtin option flexibility we cannot make private repository free accounts we create unlimited private repository five users github education github education offers free access various developer tools github partners provides realworld experience we create project college days github show creativity world we collaborate public repositories companies impress many communities already partners github github organizes campus programs school see eligibility apply campus program visit github schools student apply github student developer pack github student developer pack offers free access tools services used professional developers lets understand student developer pack what github student developer pack github student developer pack one best resources start developer student apply github student developer pack offers benefits github partners also provides free access github pro account well developers tools courses eligibility github student developer pack following eligibility criteria apply github student developer you must github account you currently enrolled degree diplomagranting courses like high school secondary school university college homeschool educational institution you must school college issued valid email address document prove student data you must complete years age how apply github student developer pack below steps apply github student developer pack step visit github education click top right option get benefit step under getting benefit option describe whether student faculty step add academic email address next prompt academic proof step upload academic proof you capture image device place uploading place valid academic id proof current academic status frame click take photo step enter details like name fill description whats plan using github step verify application details click submit option application approved notified confirmation email processed within days how use github question prevalent developers never used github tutorial assist overcoming question nothing worry necessary steps using github follows create github account github login github repository create repository create file create branches create github account first step explore benefits github create github account github provides free pro membership user we explore many exciting useful things pro account we explore unlimited private repository control user access create github account visit github click signup option upper right corner fill necessary details sign like name email address password click next select plan option under option see plan select plan whether want pro member would like continue free account after selecting plan confirmation link send email address activate account clicking received link ready go github github login log github account use github service login account click signin option upper right corner ask email id password you log entering credentials first login homepage ask create first repository options like exploring repository github repository repositories data structures used github store metadata files directories encloses collection files well history changes made files generally repository considered project folder single project one repository create repository we create unlimited public repository unlimited private repository pro user github create repository github click symbol upper right corner login screen options available like import repository gist organization new project create repository choose new repository option given list when first log account see ui follows github asks learn git github without code ask read hello world guide first uses also create repository project click new repository option fill required details like repository name description select access repository you also initialize repository readme file after filling details click create repository option create repository consider image hence created public repository how create private repository we set repository private initialization make manage accessibility repository private repository feature allowed pro members pro members create unlimited repositories set access github free account want change repositorys visibility public private lose access features like protected branches github pages github pages site automatically removed account hence created repository set access now set create first file lets create file create file github creating file straight forward process lets create file newly created repository consider snap repository distinct options available add files repository github allows us design upload files create file click create new file option open file structure look like follows enter file name box type code editor area bottom page commit options available consider snap image give commit message first text area description second text area also specify whether want commit master branch want create new branch click commit new file option we successfully added committed new file repository we edit delete file project many options available like edit delete raw blame history consider snap file hence learned create file commit changes now see create new branch how create new branch branches pointer snapshots changes branches created particular purpose like fixing bug testing release understand types branches visit git flow complex merge unstable code main code base also facilitates clean future history merging main branch master branch default branch repository lets understand create branch github create new feature branch drag branch option repository option list available branches search option available branch search requested branch repository create new branch given name consider image also create branch add file make commit asks commit changes existing branch create new one learn branches visit git branch connect github computer github download we connect github computer github allows downloading desktop application also connect github repository computer git different kinds audiences people love git commands love attractive user interface work people love user interface github desktop application one best git clients lets see features features github desktop desktop application github incredible features make collaboration easy contributor some attractive features follows attributing commits collaborators easily checkout branches create prpull request broad editor shell integration opensource lets understand install system github desktop windows setup github desktop must already github account fast straight forward way contribute github developed make straightforward processes github github desktop opensource
