formats also appeared similar storage formats much different bluray modern disk storage format provides several advantages dvds main difference bluray dvd storage capacity streaming quality compared dvds bluray store huge amount data also video quality much better dvd topic understand bluray dvds two differentiated what dvd dvd stands digital versatile disk digital video disc digital optical disc storage format used store kind digital data especially used store photographs music videos some dvds mainly used store videos watched using dvd players others may software programs computer files first dvd format invented developed year released year store huge amount data compared compact discs cds within dimensions also provides better picture quality compared cd vhs larger data pits advantages provide standard definition video quality costeffective compatible old modern dvd players bdps durable disadvantages storage capacity less compared modern bluray discs cannot provide highdefinition quality images what bluray bluray digital disc storage format similar cd dvd designed record play huge amount data highdefinition quality store several hours videos highquality named bluray blue laser used read disc enables store information greater density compared redlaser used dvd blueviolet shorter wavelength compared red laser allows user store information within smaller area bluray advanced version dvds developed collaboratively hitachi lg matsushita panasonic pioneer philips samsung sharp sony thomson year size bluray disc millimeters diameter millimeters thickness size cd dvd storage capacity bluray gb per single layer gb duallayer bluray disc cannot played current cd dvd players players lack blueviolet laser required read bluray disc however cd dvd played bluray disc players bdps advantages store large amount data within one disc provides highquality videos provides backward compatibility disadvantage costeffective dvds bluray disc cannot played using dvd players how find best bluray disc common question among bluray buyers choose identify best bluray disc unfortunately cannot identify checking boxcover generally movies tv shows released onwards look good bluray original content adapted transferred highdefinition bluray discs old movies may look good provided remaster treatment hence recommended check bluray remastered original source feature comparison blurays dvd now lets compare bluray dvd based different features storage capacity already discussed introduction section bluray disc formats capable storing huge amount data compared dvd general standard dvd store gb data means movie hours movie hours need two dvds doublelayer dvds store gb data contrast bluray disc store gb data singlelayer gb data doublelayer disc image resolution image resolution defines quality picture means picture looks playing disc dvds picture quality standard definition sd cannot get highdefinition video picture quality using dvds time bluray discs designed provide highdefinition picture quality provides us best possible picture hd capability laser technology used both blurays dvds disc based optical storage use laser technology read disc dvd uses red laser read disc works nm wavelength hand bluray discs work blue laser works shorter wavelength nm means read information precisely closely disc construction both bluray dvds look identical naked eyes disc diameter discs mm also thickness mm bluray discs much scratchresistant compared dvd security bluray discs much secured compared dvds comparison chart bluray dvds blurays dvd bluray optical disc format store different types data including videos dvd also optical disc storage format store different types data used computer storage capacity bluray disc gb data singlelayer disc doublelayer disc contain storage data gb standard dvd store gb data doublelayer dvd store gb data clearly data storage capacity dvds much smaller bluray discs discs cost little compared dvds dvds cheaper bluray discs since store large amount data hence contain videos allows provide highquality video audios due low storage capacity cannot hd video quality dvd sd standard definition data bluray modern technology dvd hence old movies still available bluray format dvds available since year hence almost old new movies available dvd formats d movies available bluray discs latest d movies available dvd format data transfer rate much high compared dvd mbps data mbps audiovideo data transfer rate much less compared bluray mbps data mbps videoaudio provides high data security data security less uses bluray laser nm wavelength uses redrays laser nm wavelength numerical aperture na bluray numerical aperture na dvd video codecs available bluray disc mpeg mpeg smpte vc video codec available dvd mpeg best suitable storing large data shooting videos best suitable store small amount data movie contains hard coating contain hard coating uses protection layer mm contains protection layer mm conclusion per discussion clear bluray provides high data storage highdefinition quality videos security compatibility compared dvd disc reasons discs useless so answer yet dvds much cheaper blurays care much picture quality want spend less amount money dvds good option dvds played dvd players also bluray players whereas bluray played using bluray players also one fact needs considered
