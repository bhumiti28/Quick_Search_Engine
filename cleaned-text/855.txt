group decision support technologies targets enabling knowledge worker executive manager analyst make superior higher decisions so data warehousing support architectures tool business executives systematically organize understand use information make strategic decisions data warehouse environment contains extraction transportation loading etl solution online analytical processing olap engine customer analysis tools applications handle process gathering information delivering business users what data warehouse data warehouse dw relational database designed query analysis rather transaction processing includes historical data derived transaction data single multiple sources data warehouse provides integrated enterprisewide historical data focuses providing support decisionmakers data modeling analysis data warehouse group data specific entire organization particular group users used daily operations transaction processing used making decisions data warehouse viewed data system following attributes database designed investigative tasks using data various applications supports relatively small number clients relatively long interactions includes current historical data provide historical perspective information its usage readintensive contains large tables data warehouse subjectoriented integrated timevariant store information support managements decisions characteristics data warehouse subjectoriented data warehouse target modeling analysis data decisionmakers therefore data warehouses typically provide concise straightforward view around particular subject customer product sales instead global organizations ongoing operations done excluding data useful concerning subject including data needed users understand subject integrated data warehouse integrates various heterogeneous data sources like rdbms flat files online transaction records requires performing data cleaning integration data warehousing ensure consistency naming conventions attributes types etc among different data sources timevariant historical information kept data warehouse example one retrieve files months months months even previous data data warehouse variations transactions system often current file kept nonvolatile data warehouse physically separate data storage transformed source operational rdbms operational updates data occur data warehouse ie update insert delete operations performed usually requires two procedures data accessing initial loading data access data therefore dw require transaction processing recovery concurrency capabilities allows substantial speedup data retrieval nonvolatile defines entered warehouse data change history data warehouse idea data warehousing came late s ibm researchers barry devlin paul murphy established business data warehouse essence data warehousing idea planned support architectural model flow information operational system decisional support environments concept attempt address various problems associated flow mainly high costs associated absence data warehousing architecture vast amount space required support multiple decision support environments large corporations ordinary various decision support environments operate independently goals data warehousing help reporting well analysis maintain organizations historical information foundation decision making need data warehouse data warehouse needed following reasons business user business users require data warehouse view summarized data past since people nontechnical data may presented elementary form store historical data data warehouse required store time variable data past input made used various purposes make strategic decisions some strategies may depending upon data data warehouse so data warehouse contributes making strategic decisions data consistency quality bringing data different sources commonplace user effectively undertake bring uniformity consistency data high response time data warehouse ready somewhat unexpected loads types queries demands significant degree flexibility quick response time benefits data warehouse understand business trends make better forecasting decisions data warehouses designed perform well enormous amounts data structure data warehouses accessible endusers navigate understand query queries would complex many normalized databases could easier build maintain data warehouses data warehousing efficient method manage demand lots information lots users data warehousing provide capabilities analyze large amount historical data prerequisites before learning data warehouse must fundamental knowledge basic database concepts schema er model structured query language etc audience tutorial help computer science students understand basictoadvanced concepts
