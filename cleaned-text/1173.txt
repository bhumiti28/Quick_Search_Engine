liquid surfaces shrink smallest possible surface area surface tension process liquids surface contact gas behaves like thin elastic layer liquids help minimize possible surface area term usually applied liquid surface interacts gas also referred interface tension surface two liquids particles like water oil surface tension determined attraction forces particles inside liquid forces attraction contact solids liquids gases work energy needed remove surface layer molecules unit area essentially equal energy responsible surface tension therefore surface tension expressed energy units joules per unit area square meters c f water surface tension joules per square meter contrast organic liquids lower surface pressures benzene alcohols whereas mercury greater surface tension net force attraction molecules decreased increasing temperature thus reducing surface tension usually surface tension calculated dynescm force dynes needed break cm long film surface tension different fluids given table liquid surface tension nm water sodium chloride hydrogen helium ethanol formula surface tension liquid particles drawn together several intermolecular forces like van der waals forces particles dragged along surface towards rest liquid seen image defined ratio surface force f length l along force following formula calculate surface tension t fl where t liquids surface tension f force l length force works si unit surface tension si unit surface tension nm newton per meter cgs centimetergramseconds unit dyncm dyne per centimeter also helpful think terms work per unit area determine situations thermodynamics case si unit jm joules per meter square unit cgs ergcm dimension surface tension mentioned formula surface tension surface tension t fl we know f ma substituting value f ma equation get mal after fundamental quantities added equation get mlt l mt examples surface tension various examples surface tension available follows floating needle carefully positioned small needle may made float waters surface even though many times solid water needle may sink quickly surface moved break surface tension washing cold water powerful wetting agent main reason washing hot water surface tension lower detergent decreases surface tension might need heating surface tension droplets shape liquid droplets responsible surface tension although easily deformed water droplets appear pulled surface layers cohesive forces spherical shape walking water tiny insects may walk water weight enough reach surface water strider clinical test jaundice surface tension normal urine dynes per centimeter drops around dynes per centimeter bile present powdered sulfur sprayed urine surface hay test float normal urine biles surface tension decreased sink soap detergents help
