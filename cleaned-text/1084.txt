genes genetic code codon protein synthesis next prev endoplasmic reticulum er cell organelle membranebound cell organelle forms interconnected network cisternae flattened sacs tubules tubes endoplasmic means inside cytoplasm meaning reticulum network originates nuclear membrane budding folds create internal space called lumen er observed first time garnier however ultrastructure er given keith r porter albert claude ernest f fullam term endoplasmic reticulum given porter present eukaryotic cells except germinal cells mature red blood corpuscles rbcs mammals absent prokaryotic cells contain membranebound structure structure endoplasmic reticulum er mainly consists cisternae tubules vesicles cisternae unbranched flattened saclike structures narrow lumen studded ribosomes originate nuclear membrane blobbing evagination turning outward nuclear membrane cisternae parallel interconnected form network besides ribosomes studded embedded surface cisterna plural cisternae lumen narrow ranges micrometre cisternae closer nucleus originate nuclear membrane divides cytoplasm two parts cytosol normal cytoplasm cisternal lumen space furthermore cisternae also called ergastoplasmic sacs produce granular substances chemicals tubules branched diverse shape cisternae vesicles dont ribosomes surface tubules formed cisternae cisternae lose ribosomes closer plasma membrane lumen wider compared cisternas lumen lumen ranges micrometre vesicles spherical structures located closer cisternae diameter around micrometre also ribosomes attached studded surface usually remain close cisternae lumen cisternae continuous perinuclear space known attached nuclear envelope membrane its side made tubules attached plasma membrane so one side attached nuclear membrane side attached plasma membrane types endoplasmic reticulum endoplasmic reticulum two types two distinct regions vary structure function presence ribosomes however two types based presence ribosomes described rough endoplasmic reticulum rer its surface studded embedded ribosomes called rough endoplasmic reticulum granular endoplasmic reticulum comprises cisternae part er looks like series canals ribosomes attached surface protein called ribophorin lumen continuous outer membrane nuclear envelope so close nuclear membrane nucleus viewed using electron microscope rer acts site protein synthesis specialized protein synthesis so proteinsynthesizing cells like fibroblasts beta cells islets langerhans contain number endoplasmic reticulum proteins formed rer may become part cell membrane secreted cell cell membrane so also helps deciding proteins remain cell leave cell besides takes part production antibodies insulin also aid transporting proteins smooth er ii smooth endoplasmic reticulum ser ribosomes surface smooth surface compared rough er mainly composed tubules located close plasma membrane ser makes lipids carbohydrates involved protein synthesis lipids fatbased molecules required energy storage membrane structure communication ser helps detoxify cell example liver cells large amount ser carry bodys detoxification furthermore cells synthesize lipid amount ser adipocytes liver cells cells produce steroid hormones like testosterone also ser leydig cells similarly follicular cells produce steroid hormones like oestrogen progesterone would ser furthermore ser present striated muscle cells termed sarcoplasmic reticulum functions endoplasmic reticulum functions smooth endoplasmic reticulum smooth er helps synthesis lipids phospholipids cholesterol also assists formation secretion steroid hormones metabolism carbohydrates responsible storing releasing calcium ions needed muscular nervous system forms desmotubules strands endoplasmic reticulum runs plasmodesmata connection two adjacent cells transport materials occurs also forms ser sarcoplasmic reticulum found muscles helps conduction motor impulse contraction muscle cells also helps removing lactic acid stored muscles also helps detoxification unwanted substances like drugs carcinogenic substances performs glycogenolysis breakdown glycogen glucose provide immediate energy especially liver cells diverse functionally enzymes rer ii functions rough endoplasmic reticulum rough er mainly responsible protein synthesis also carries protein folding also performs quality control function related correct folding proteins serves intracellular circulatory transporting system transports proteins carbohydrates organelles golgi apparatus lysosomes plasma membrane provides channels transport materials cytoplasm nucleus provides required surface area cellular reactions cavity lumen provides passage secretory products helps golgi bodies producing vesicles golgian vacuoles providing membrane supports membrane biogenesis formation nuclear envelope membrane cell division formation skeletal framework forms new nuclear membrane nuclear division telophase polypeptide chains ribosomes pass membrane rer accumulate lumen here chains undergo tailoring molecular folding maturation form functional proteins takes information outside inside cell also allows exchange information different cell organelles cell common functions endoplasmic reticulum acts framework cell also called cytoskeleton structure helps transferring information nucleus cell organelle cells vesicles form budding cisternae tubule transport proteins rough endoplasmic reticulum lipid smooth endoplasmic reticulum golgi body so helps transport proteins lipids golgi bodies helps cell plate formation cell division cell plate made fragmoplasts pieces er golgi body provides mechanical support colloidal cytoplasmic matrix allows exchange molecules across membrane diffusion osmosis active transport er membrane contains various important enzymes needed many vital synthesis processes enzymes include glucose phosphate nadh diaphorase mg activated atpase etc helps maintain cytoplasmic vacuolar system allows cell organelles connect next topicgolgi body prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest tutorials soapui rpa manual t cucumber appium postgresql solr
