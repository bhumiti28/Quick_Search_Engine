math word math stands mathematics field study word mathematics originates greek word máthema meaning máthema word science knowledge learning both math maths short forms mathematics so word mathematics math short words often used students schools arithmetic geometry algebra definitions math commonly accepted definition math aristotle defined mathematics science quantity definition given aristotle prevailed th century study numbers shapes patterns called math words define term math field study uses numbers symbols measurement properties relationships quantities sets according german philosophers carl friedrich gauss mathematics queen sciences modern philosophers consider mathematics science science based empirical observations seek understand aspect phenomena while math defines relationship quantities objects seeks use logic understand mathematics relate phenomena study math includes following numbers study numbers involves count things structure study structures involves things organized subfield structure called algebra place study place involves arrangements things subfield place called geometry change study change involves things become different subfield change called analysis why math important math important daily lives reality implemented everywhere useful solving problems occur real world reason many people besides mathematicians study use mathematics many fields natural science engineering medicine finance etc uses mathematics following reasons makes mathematics powerful tool math involved around us so essential powerful discipline todays world our perspective important issues facing us individuals families businesses nations provides effective way building mental discipline improves mental rigor developing logical analytical problemsolving
