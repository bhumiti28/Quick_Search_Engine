cells human body animals plants etc capable storing supplying energy needed cells which following primary function hemoglobin make blood calories kill harmful bacteria transport o none show answer workspace answer c transport o explanation haemoglobin present red blood cells transports oxygen tissues human body hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout body iron hemoglobin gives rbcblood red color respiration plants takes place only night only day only evening day night show answer workspace answer d day night explanation term respiration biochemical process used release energy organic compounds used carry various physical activities respiration plants takes place alltime day night what happens human body respiration formation new cells formation glucose oxidization glucose formation protein show answer workspace answer c oxidization glucose explanation respiration continuous process occurs cells living organisms produce energy process energy released breaking glucose cells body left atrium receives pure blood superior venacava pulmonary artery pulmonary veins none show answer workspace answer c pulmonary veins explanation pulmonary veins transfer oxygenated blood lungs heart from lungs oxygenated blood enters left atrium left upper chamber pulmonary vein enters left ventricle left lower chamber from oxygenated blood pumped throughout body via aorta arteries which following procedure used clean blood person separating urea filtration osmosis dialysis none show answer workspace answer c dialysis explanation dialysis procedure used clean persons blood separating urea which following tube connects kidneys urinary bladder ureter urethra tubule nephron show answer workspace answer ureter explanation ureter narrow tubes carry urine kidneys bladder ureter tubes connect kidney urinary bladder which following body organ filters dirty blood lungs heart kidneys none show answer workspace answer c kidneys explanation kidneys filter toxins waste blood kidneys beanshaped organs filter blood remove waste part cell glycolysis process occurs nucleus mitochondria chloroplast cytoplasm show answer workspace answer d cytoplasm explanation glycolysis takes place cytoplasm cytoplasm gellike material fluid present inside cell surrounded cell membrane mostly comprises water salts proteins organelles cell remain suspended cytoplasm process roots plants
