important features need know handbrake hardware acceleration some gpus contain dedicated hardware video encoding decoding hardware usually provided scenarios quick powerefficient compressed video desired video conferencing streaming video less often used transcoding compression efficiency rarely matches optimized software encoder codec however handbrake still provides owners compatible
