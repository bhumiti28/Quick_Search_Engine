provides introduction ai help understand concepts behind artificial intelligence tutorial also discussed various popular topics history ai applications ai deep learning machine learning natural language processing reinforcement learning qlearning intelligent agents various search algorithms etc our ai tutorial prepared elementary level easily understand complete tutorial basic concepts highlevel concepts what artificial intelligence todays world technology growing fast getting touch different new technologies day day here one booming technologies computer science artificial intelligence ready create new revolution world making intelligent machinesthe artificial intelligence around us currently working variety subfields ranging general specific selfdriving cars playing chess proving theorems playing music painting etc ai one fascinating universal fields computer science great scope future ai holds tendency cause machine work human artificial intelligence composed two words artificial intelligence artificial defines manmade intelligence defines thinking power hence ai means manmade thinking power so define ai branch computer science create intelligent machines behave like human think like humans able make decisions artificial intelligence exists machine human based skills learning reasoning solving problems artificial intelligence need preprogram machine work despite create machine programmed algorithms work intelligence awesomeness ai believed ai new technology people says per greek myth mechanical men early days work behave like humans why artificial intelligence before learning artificial intelligence know importance ai learn following main reasons learn ai help ai create software devices solve realworld problems easily accuracy health issues marketing traffic issues etc help ai create personal virtual assistant cortana google assistant siri etc help ai build robots work environment survival humans risk ai opens path new technologies new devices new opportunities goals artificial intelligence following main goals artificial intelligence replicate human intelligence solve knowledgeintensive tasks intelligent connection perception action building machine perform tasks requires human intelligence proving theorem playing chess plan surgical operation driving car traffic creating system exhibit intelligent behavior learn new things demonstrate explain advise user what comprises artificial intelligence artificial intelligence part computer science even vast requires lots factors contribute create ai first know intelligence composed intelligence intangible part brain combination reasoning learning problemsolving perception language understanding etc achieve factors machine software artificial intelligence requires following discipline mathematics biology psychology sociology computer science neurons study statistics advantages artificial intelligence following main advantages artificial intelligence high accuracy less errors ai machines systems prone less errors high accuracy takes decisions per preexperience information highspeed ai systems highspeed fastdecision making ai systems beat chess champion chess game high reliability ai machines highly reliable perform action multiple times high accuracy useful risky areas ai machines helpful situations defusing bomb exploring ocean floor employ human risky digital assistant ai useful provide digital assistant users ai technology currently used various ecommerce websites show products per customer requirement useful public utility ai useful public utilities selfdriving car make journey safer hasslefree facial recognition security purpose natural language processing communicate human humanlanguage etc disadvantages artificial intelligence every technology disadvantages thesame goes artificial intelligence being advantageous technology still disadvantages need keep mind creating ai system following disadvantages ai high cost hardware software requirement ai costly requires lots maintenance meet current world requirements cant think box even making smarter machines ai still cannot work box robot work trained programmed feelings emotions ai machines outstanding performer still feeling cannot make kind emotional attachment human may sometime harmful users proper care taken increase dependency machines increment technology people getting dependent devices hence losing mental capabilities original creativity humans creative imagine new ideas still ai machines cannot beat power human intelligence cannot creative imaginative prerequisite before learning artificial intelligence must fundamental knowledge following understand concepts easily any computer language c c java python etcknowledge
