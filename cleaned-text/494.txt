difference emulation virtualization article discuss difference emulation virtualization main difference emulation computer programs ability electronic device emulate behavior another program device hand virtualization process creating virtual instance computer hardware platforms before making comparison first know emulation virtualization what emulation computing emulator hardware software enables one device named host function like systems named guest perfect way execute hardware software system emulation brings greater overhead also benefits relatively inexpensive easily accessible allows us run programs become redundant available system emulator changes cpu instructions required architecture executes another architecture successfully emulation systems could accessed remotely anyone simpler use without affecting underlying os excellent capacity embedded os development without considering hosts capabilities emulation usually manage size design test dut what virtualization developing virtual instance computing resources including computer server hardware components softwarebased resource operating system single physical system divided many virtual servers virtualization virtual machines vms run dedicated hardware without relying we split single physical device separate independent worlds known virtual machines virtualization allows us create several computer simulations host hardware dedicated resources serverbased system architecture sbsa features host system hypervisor virtual machine monitor vmm much efficient various stages implementation main differences emulation virtualization following key differences emulation virtualization emulation process needs software bridge unlike virtualization whereas virtualization hardware would accessed directly major distinction virtual machine emulator virtual machine directly executes code various domains language use interpreter required basic emulation interpreter translates source code translates host systems readable format processing emulator guest operating system runon physical hardware contrast virtual machines emulators sluggish emulators depend cpu vms uses cpu virtualization physically places layer hardware unlike emulation control access virtualization allows us access host resources helps resource sharing guest machines headtohead comparison emulation virtualization following chart discuss headtohead comparison emulation virtualization virtualization emulation virtual machine may execute code directly thats available various languages emulator needs interpreter translate source code virtualization hardware may directly accessible terms emulation need software connector access hardware virtual machines solutions costlier emulator comparatively cheaper virtualization virtual machines relatively quicker operation emulators comparatively slower virtualization virtualization offers better backup features emulation falls short virtualization far backup recovery considered conclusion we get confused two term emulation often used describe virtual environment server virtualization we use complete hardware software emulation want emulate top host device virtualization emulate parts hardware according specifications help guest os run correctly architecture key similarity virtualization emulation programs one way another imitate hardware both lets imitate run program one setting intended different techniques virtualization emulation approaches offer us options deploying multiple isolated services without using separate platform all used fulfil
