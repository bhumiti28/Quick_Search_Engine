general purpose programming james gosling sun microsystems multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev least common denominator least common denominator also called lowest common denominator abbreviated lcd fraction bottom number said denominator fractions number written form pq p numerator q denominator defined smallest number common denominator given set fractions during addition subtraction fractions generally required common denominators different find lcd fractions adding subtracting least common denominator lcm two numbers generally used add subtract compare fractions least common denominator required cannot add fractions different denominators lets try add following two fractions difficult add denominators so find common number simplify calculate lcd fractions find lcm least common multiple denominators two methods find lcd now see ways calculate lcd fractions method lengthy method usually used follow steps given find lcm using multiples numbers list multiple number first common multiple found pick smallest multiple common given numbers lets understand method using example suppose find lcd fractions see denominators fractions now write multiples denominators multiples multiples multiples we see common multiples numbers least multiple among multiples so least common denominator say lowest common denominator fractions method another method finding least common denominator two fractions here showing steps calculating least common denominator first count number times prime factor appears factorizations take largest count prime number write prime number many times counted second step lcd product prime numbers written we also understand example suppose two fractions denominators fractions we calculate prime factorization prime factorization denominators x x x x prime number occurring three times prime number occurring one time product x x x so lcd fractions lets see questions finding least common denominator ques find lcd ans here denominators fractions given question multiples denominators x x so least common denominator x x ques find lcd ans here denominators fractions given question multiples denominators so least common denominator x ques what least common denominator ans here denominators fractions given question multiples denominators x x x so least common denominator x x x ques what lowest common denominator ans here denominators fractions given question multiples denominators x x x x so least common denominator x x x ques what result ans here denominators fractions given question multiples denominators x x so least common denominator x x add fractions using common denominator first change given fractions equivalent fractions using denominator x x x x so ques what lowest common denominator ans given question integer improper fraction also written written now fractions denominators given fractions multiples denominators x x x lcd x x x so least common denominator next
