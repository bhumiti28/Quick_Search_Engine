known video controller display adapter video board graphics card video adapter expansion card controls calculates images appearance screen used improve picture quality show display even cannot see page without video card accelerates video throughput intermediate device picture instance video card more clearly inside computer piece hardware process graphics portion processing load normally cpu handles task due extra processing power video ram gamers use video card instead integrated graphics almost able run programs efficiently modern times programs graphically oriented video card ability speed d d graphics rendering like web browsers photo editors programs may benefit d acceleration video games cad design programs likely advantage cards d acceleration libraries like opengl directx supported video cards manipulating graphics libraries commands programmers use code some commands among may used casting light morphing polygons moving rotating object creating shadows create graphicallyoriented programs opengl directx standards provide easier way developers computer also makes compulsory involve supported video card terms running programs components contained graphics card given gpu dvi videobios videomemory video cards sophisticated early times computer graphics able send output data come processor display due output text format worked well result early operating systems color complex graphics modern times video cards similar coprocessors means instead forwarding simple signal onto display video cards add processing power furthermore video cards capability checking quality output important video card facts only limited range video card formats supported motherboard therefore making purchase always check motherboard manufacturer many modern computers onboard video gpus integrated directly onto motherboard include video expansion cards makes computer less powerful graphics system also less expensive option appropriate users interest latest gams additional graphics tasks most motherboards come onboard video provide ability bios disable chip video card installed expansion slot how check video card i have windows users use device manager check video cards easiest way see video card users under display adapters section list video card found also tool like speccy used see graphics card free system information tool helps identify bus interface amount memory device id temperature manufacturer bios version model video card information another way see video card system computer case need open computer case see video card installed system need replace video card opening computer case required option want see video card information better use software mentioned components video card graphics card here essential components video card gpu graphics processing unit every graphics card gpu heart graphics card primary component graphics card handles mathematical computations needed create visuals usually placed underneath fan heatsink performing calculations processor get extremely hot some gpu processors provide advanced functionalities offer d graphics look smoother fullscene antialiasing memory memory needed storing complete information accessed quickly time right although gpu figuring display images memory place stores complex textures needed ready used situation ram memory comes handy gpu fetches textures memory forwards ram processing ramdac accepts ram forwards monitor lcd screen display ramdac converts image analog signal randomaccess memory digital analog converter sends monitor lcd screen help display cable compared memory use desktop laptop graphics card memory ram much faster internal interface primary function internal interface connect graphics card motherboard early time agp accelerated graphics port interface used graphics cards connect motherboard graphics cards use pci express x interface connect motherboard much faster efficient compared agp also pci express x slot contained motherboard cannot use card dvi hdmi vga ports external interface graphics card formed dvi hdmi vga ports help relevant cable connect monitor lcd screen graphics card both types interfaces dvi hdmi highdefinition multimedia interface included highend graphics cards lowend ones contain vga dvi digital video interface ports addition major components resistors capacitors diodes also components presented graphics card different types graphic cards add separate video card computer enhance speed video video games many types graphics cards available market know kind card better computer onboard expansion slot onboard graphics card included budgetbased pcs lieu separate graphics cards usually decoding highquality video playing graphicsintensive games onboard card powerful onboard graphics cannot remove physically therefore need replace onboard graphics addon graphics card disable onboard graphics computers bios install addon graphics card pci express pci express standard video cards only two manufacturers nvidia ati produce pci express graphics cards latest pci express comprises three architectures agp early mid s agp standard graphics card type stands accelerated graphics port modern times cards replaced pci express widely available also agp ports included hardware manufacturers systems radeon hd series introduced ati however new card released till external graphics cards since manufacturers laptop computers stopped including space addon graphics card laptops manufacturers started produce external graphics cards improving graphics capabilities legacy graphics cards graphics cards like pci vesa local bus isa graphics cards widely used modern times graphics cards compatible current versions windows therefore aforementioned cards popular graphics card history standards often printer port included graphics card since printer would print information lower resolution green screen new graphics standard came video graphics array vga introduced ibm resolutions x vga display could ability support colors perhaps vga analog difference preceding formats vga displays digital although may older option take action digital analog compared strict onoff nature digital offers ability vary signal possible combination now alldigital display solutions offered manufacturers graphicscard features analog adapters over time svga cards designed basis vga manufacturer card increased color depth added resolutions different ways lastly svga provided x resolution million colors graphics cards follow industry standards make users capable selecting cards pc among variety graphics cards comparing basic vga specification buy card offer higher colors resolution geforce series released nvidia original card popular among overclockers overclockers programs use program known riva tuner sli supports multivideo cards purevideo technology provides better video quality gtx introduced geforce radeon hd released amd also took ati what video card do million individual pixels included average computer monitor ability display particular color create complex pictures however cpu central processing unit screen computers need video card serve middleman cpu sends request video card needs something displayed video card figures exactly visualize instructions pixels function video cards canvas analogy cable vga svideo dvi sends information monitor make visuals display screen video card must first start basic wireframe comes translating binary data d visuals include lighting effects textures complex colors process needs repeated times per second get optimal performance visuals start look sluggish video card ports various types video ports used video cards follows dvi svideo vga hdmi dvi digital video interface dvi video display interface developed pc industry transmit digital video content display devices ability transmit video content resolutions high x from computer monitor dvi virtually eliminates signal loss keeps data digital form some tvs also use dvi connection dvi cables transmit audio signals therefore hdmi common transmit audiovideo signals svideo svideo analog video connection standard stands super video video transmission format transmits electrical signals wires represent original video kind connection found video devices uses round connector interface cable also used connecting vcrs tvs video cameras computers well dvd players vga vga popular display standard stands video graphics adapter array developed ibm introduced connection devices like monitors projectors offers x resolution color display screens colors shown resolution lowered x vga cable capable lower quality display lower resolutions screens uses analog signals image example vga cable port connector hdmi hdmi interface connector mainly used devices like dvd player
