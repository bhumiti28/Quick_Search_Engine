testing interview next prev manual testing manual testing software testing process test cases executed manually without using automated tool all test cases executed tester manually according end users perspective ensures whether application working mentioned requirement document test cases planned implemented complete almost percent software application test case reports also generated manually manual testing one fundamental testing processes find visible hidden defects software difference expected output output given software defined defect developer fixed defects handed tester retesting manual testing mandatory every newly developed software automated testing testing requires great efforts time gives surety bugfree software manual testing requires knowledge manual testing techniques automated testing tool manual testing essential one software testing fundamentals automation possible why need manual testing whenever application comes market unstable bug issues creating problem endusers using dont want face kinds problems need perform one round testing make application bug free stable deliver quality product client application bug free enduser use application conveniently test engineer manual testing heshe test application enduser perspective get familiar product helps write correct test cases application give quick feedback application types manual testing various methods used manual testing each technique used according testing criteria types manual testing given white box testing black box testing gray box testing whitebox testing white box testing done developer check every line code giving test engineer since code visible developer testing thats also known white box testing information white box testing refers link httpswwwjavatpointcomwhiteboxtesting black box testing black box testing done test engineer check functionality application software according customer clients needs code visible performing testing thats known blackbox testing information blackbox testing refers link httpswwwjavatpointcomblackboxtesting gray box testing gray box testing combination white box black box testing performed person knew coding testing single person performs white box well blackbox testing application known gray box testing get details gray box testing refers link httpswwwjavatpointcomgreyboxtesting how perform manual testing first tester observes documents related software select testing areas tester analyses requirement documents cover requirements stated customer tester develops test cases according requirement document all test cases executed manually using black box testing white box testing bugs occurred testing team informs development team development team fixes bugs handed software testing team retest software build process once requirement collected provide two different team development testing team after getting requirement concerned developer start writing code meantime test engineer understands requirement prepares required documents developer may complete code store control version tool after code changes ui changes handle one separate team known build team build team take code start compile compress code help build tool once got output output goes zip file known build application softwareeach build unique number like b b particular build installed test server after test engineer access test server help test url start testing application test engineer found bug heshe reported concerned developer developer reproduce bug test server fix bug store code control version tool install new updated file remove old file process continued get stable build once got stable build handed customer note once collect file control version tool use build tool compile code highlevel language machine level language after compilation file size increase compress particular file dumped test server process done build team developer build team developer test lead build team directly handle zip install application test server inform test engineer generally cant get new build every bug else time wasted creating builds note build team main job build team create application build converting highlevel language lowlevel language build software used convert code application format consists set features bug fixes handed test engineer testing purposes becomes stable control version tool software application used following purpose tool save different types files always secured access file tools using login credentials primary objective tools track changes done existing files example build process let see one example understand build process work real scenarios soon test engineer gets bug send developers need time analyze heshe fixes bug test engineer cant give collection bug developer decided many bugs fix according time test engineer decided bug fixed first according needs test engineers cannot afford stop testing test engineer getting mail know bug fixed list bug fixes time increase first build developers write code different features end heshe bug fixes numbers days decreased note test cycle test cycle time duration given test engineer test every build differences two build bugs found one build fixed future build depends test engineers requirement each new build modified version old one modifications could bug fixes adding new features how frequently getting new build beginning used get weekly builds latest stage testing application getting stable used get new build days two days daily basis well how many builds get consider one year project duration got builds when get bug fixes generally understand bug fixes test cycle completed collection bugs fixed one build handover next builds advantages manual testing require programming knowledge using black box method used test dynamically changing gui designs tester interacts software real user able discover usability user interface issues ensures software hundred percent bugfree costeffective easy learn new testers disadvantages manual testing requires large number human resources timeconsuming tester develops test cases based skills experience evidence covered functions test cases cannot used need develop separate test cases new software provide testing aspects testing since two teams work together sometimes difficult understand others motives mislead process manual testing tools manual testing different types testing like unit integration security performance bug tracking various tools jira bugzilla mantis zap nunit tessy loadrunner citrus sonarqube etc available market some tools opensource commercial information testing tools refers link httpswwwjavatpointcomsoftwaretestingtools lets us understand one one loadrunner commonly used performance testing tools loadrunner mainly used support performance testing wide range procedures number approaches application environments main purpose executing loadrunner tool classify common sources performance issues quickly features loadrunner loadrunner tool contains nnumbers applications reduces time understand describe reports we get thorough performance test reports using loadrunner tool reduce cost distributed load testing also offer operational tool deployment tracking citrus citrus integration testing tool commonly used test framework written java programming language mostly used request respond serverside clientside validate xml json files accomplish endtoend use case testing citrus supports several http jms soap protocols characteristics citrus following important features citrus tool used send receive messages citrus available opensource licensed market delivers lowcost solution we authenticate database using citrus tool describe sequence messages offer test plan document test coverage creates message verifies responses zap zap opensource web application security scanner stands zed attack proxy just like tools also written java programming language effective open web application security projects owasp features zap supports many operating systems windows linux os x pluginbased architecture contains online marketplace permits us add new updated features zaps gui control panel easy use nunit nunit one frequently used unit testing tools opensource tool primarily derived junit completely written c programming language suitable net languages words say nunit tool entirely redesigned become advantage many net language qualities example reflectionrelated capabilities other custom attributes characteristics nunit allows assertions static method advantage class sustains datadriven tests supports several platforms like net core xamarin mobile silverlight efficient framework ability nunit help us execute tests simultaneously uses console runner
