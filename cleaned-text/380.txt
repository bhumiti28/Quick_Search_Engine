testing interview next prev difference between hld lld section going discuss difference hld lld see brief introduction what hld hld stands highlevel design designer focus various models like decision tables decision trees flow diagrams flow charts data dictionary solution architect develops highlevel design used specifies complete description architecture application hld involves system architecture database design brief description systems services platforms relationships among modules hld also known macrolevel system design changes business client requirement highlevel solution highlevel design created lowlevel design what lld lld stands lowlevel design designer focus components like user interface ui lowlevel design created developer manager designers also known microlevel detailed design lld change highlevel solution detailed solution lowlevel design specifics detailed description modules implies lld involves system components actual logic goes deep modules
