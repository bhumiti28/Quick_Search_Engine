general purpose programming james gosling sun microsystems multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev animal cells eukaryotic all cells fall two broad categories known eukaryotic cell prokaryotic cell whether bacteria archaea eukaryote before discuss whether animal cells eukaryotic prokaryotic important know eukaryotic prokaryotic cells key difference what eukaryotic cell term eukaryotic also known true nucleus eu true karyotic nucleus true kernel presence true nucleus eukaryotic cell membranebound nucleus components including plasma membrane ribosomes golgi apparatus chloroplast mitochondria cytoplasm several rodshaped chromosomes also combines membranebound compartments sacs called organelles means little organ specialized cellular functions helps reproduce survival similar organs body special functions what prokaryotic cell term prokaryotic refers false nucleus pro false karyotic nucleus nucleus prokaryotic cell singlecelled also called unicellular organism doesnt contain nucleus membranebound components cell bit different eukaryotes cell its dna found center cell called nucleoid most prokaryotes bacteria cell wall peptidoglycan made amino acids sugars many polysaccharide capsule cell wall gives extra layer protection maintains cells shape prevents dehydration capsule prokaryotic cell makes attach surface surrounding some cells pili flagella fimbriae most pili used exchange genetic material time reproduction known conjugation flagella used movement fimbriae used cell attach host cell common components cells all cells four common components given plasma membrane outer cover separates cells interior parts surrounding environment cytoplasm jellylike region inside cell cellular components exist dna genetic component cell ribosomes particle synthesis proteins animal cell definition animal cells surrounded plasma membrane also termed cell membrane contains membranebounded nucleus organelles plasma membrane layer separates interior cell outside environment cells features raise kingdom animalia animal cells dose cell wall plant fungi cell contains most animal plant cells range size micrometers unicellular micrometers visible via microscope animals multicellular diploid multicellular means multiple cells combine form complete organism term diploid cell means chromosomes animal cells present homologous pairs period sexual reproduction cellular division process called meiosis essential produce haploid daughter cells gametes when two haploid cells get fuse together form diploid zygote gets divides multiplies new organism like complex humans animal cell structure animal cells mostly smaller compare plant cells irregular shape due lack cell wall typical animal cell structure given comprises several components plasma membrane cell membrane semipermeable layer fats protein surrounds cell primary role cell membrane protect cell surrounding environment addition also responsible entry exit nutrients another micro bacillus cell nucleus organ contains many suborganelles nucleolus nucleosomes chromatin dna genetic materials also found nucleus nuclear membrane doublelayer structure covers nucleus also called nuclear envelope golgi apparatus flat smooth saclike organelle manufacture sorts packs proteins transfer particles entire cell golgi apparatus located near nucleus cell lysosome cell vesicles lysosomes round organelles surrounded membrane contains digestive enzymes helps digestion removes waste products breaks toxic compounds excretes recycles cell structures endoplasmic reticulum er composed thin curved network membranous sac originates cellular organelle nucleus found two different types rough endoplasmic reticulum smooth endoplasmic reticulum rough endoplasmic reticulum continues outer layer nuclear envelops contains ribosomes smooth endoplasmic reticulum continuous rough endoplasmic reticulum separate nuclear membrane contains ribosomes ribosome small organs made rnarich cytoplasmic particles synthesize proteins vacuole organelles bonded membranes present inside cell involved maintaining size storage water food waste etc cytoplasm jellylike substance contains entire organelles cells enclosed within plasma membrane material found within cytoplasm called nucleoplasm contained nuclear membrane centrosome small organ found nucleus thick center including radiated tubules centrosome founds microtubules arise mitochondrion doublemembrane spherical rodshaped organs generate energy cell also called powerhouse cell generate energy cells nucleopore small holes present nuclear membrane helps transportation nucleic acid proteins materials entire cell animal cell also found different shapes may flat oval spherical curved concave rodshaped rectangle most cells microscopic shape see via microscope yes animal cells eukaryotic based discussion animal cell eukaryotic cells properties say animal cells eukaryotic animal cells eukaryotic defined nucleus membranebound organelles like mitochondria golgi apparatus endoplasmic reticulum other membranebound nucleus eukaryotic cell cells also indicate presence dna inside nucleus also include cellular structures perform specific functions required cell proper function animal kingdom different eukaryotic organisms animal tissues combine extracellular matrix triple helix proteins called collagen hand plant fungal cells combine form tissues group molecules pectin difference prokaryotic eukaryotic cell prokaryotes eukaryotes type cell cell always unicellular cell may unicellular multicellular nucleus nucleus absent nucleoid region cell nucleus present cell cell size cell size ranges m m diameter cell size ranges m m diameter cell wall mostly present chemically complex present chemically simple cytoplasm cytoplasm present cell organelles absent cytoplasm cell organelles present plasmids present prokaryotes rarely found eukaryotes cells ribosome ribosomes smaller size ribosomes larger size lysosome lysosomes centrosomes absent lysosomes centrosomes present mitochondria absent present cell division cell division happens binary fission cell division happens mitosis ribosomes present size smaller spherical present comparatively larger size linear shape flagella its flagella smaller size its flagella larger dna arrangement circular linear endoplasmic reticulum absent present reproduction reproduction happens via asexual reproduction happens via asexual sexual example bacteria archaea animal plant cell next topicgoogle input tools prev
