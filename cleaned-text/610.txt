recorder jfr powerful performance monitoring profiling tool diagnoses collects monitors running java application continuous basis even catastrophic failure integrated jvm tool provides powerful gui application performance analysis used heavily loaded production environment applications profiling blackbox analysis support debugging section discuss java flight recorder detail along also understand concepts uses architecture jmc basic commands jfr what java flight recorder jfr first introduced jdk its functionality written java application diagnosis tool captures jvm application data data includes garbage collection synchronization compiler cpu usage exceptions io etc also provides samplingbased profiler help profiler get accurate data low overhead uses circular buffer store data figure depicts concept circular flight recording buffer new data continuously added buffer old data removed jfr tool cannot used standalone so used java mission control jmc jmc tool contains plugin allows us visualize data gathered jfr apart jfr tools provided jdk monitoring profiling java visualvm jconsole java mission control diagnostic command tool note java visualvm part oracle open jdk distribution past since java java visualvm removed following figure depicts evolution jfr note want use jfr tool production commercial license required use benefits java flight recorder similar jfr tools also available jfr advantages follows real time analysis provides realtime analysis java application integrated tools provides enhanced data jfr uses articulate data model makes easier crossreference filter events provide coherent data minimizes ownership cost minimizes cost spending less time diagnosing problem troubleshooting therefore minimizes operating cost improves system efficiency allows thirdparty event provider jfr also monitor thirdparty applications like weblogic server products uses flight recorder black box analysis jfr continuously adds application information circular buffer information collected buffer accessed anomaly detected find causes profiling profiling form dynamic program analysis means measures performancerelated issue following two profiling done jfr cpu profiling profile performance application memory profiling analyze memory application profiling information embraces garbage collection detail memory lock profiles time complexity frequency duration function call thread samples profiling information serves aid application optimization improves application latency throughput support debugging data collected jfr essential contacting oracle support help diagnose issues java application architecture jfr jfr architecture consists following things jfr contains runtime engine produces recordings runtime engine two components ie agent producers work agent handle buffers disk mbeans etc provides dynamic library written c java code producers write data buffers jfr plugin enables us work jmc we easily start stop configure recording gui jfr components two main concepts jfr ie event dataflow lets briefly discuss jfr events jfr everything event collects events happen jvm along application logs events represent state jvm application information collected jfr divided two parts ie header payload header includes size event id end time payload contains eventspecific data besides also includes start time thread id stack trace id optional payloads while recording events must define following two things producer basically producer metadata namespace event captures jfr mandatory register event type producer producer longer referenced event types removed bad practice want produce producer create instance producer follows
