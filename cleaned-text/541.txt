difference er model relational model er model relational model two aspects data model dbms used construct databases physical logical view levels article explains complete overview er model relational model difference models common part interview question key distinction er model entityspecific relational model tablespecific before making comparison first know data models what er model er model stands entityrelationship model peter chen developed model consists collection entities real word objects relationships describes databases conceptual view we must ensure two entities identical context er model describes systems logical view data perspective formed entity set relationship set attributes model entities come entity set relations entities come relationship set attributes describe properties entities let us understand er model example suppose two realworld entities named student branch form entity set now easily form relation student belongs branch shows get relationship set er model noted er model content must conform constraints like mapping cardinality finally attributes entities would student studid studname address mobile mailid branch branchid branchname numofstud what relational model ef codd developed relational model he proposed model well nonprocedural approach modeling data form relations tables relational model tables usually interpreted relations model database using er diagrams must convert relational model implemented one rdbms languages sql mysql relational model table contains rows columns number rows number columns must definite table rows called tuples include complete information specific entities records set tuples relational model also known recordbased model table columns called attributes characterize tables properties store values attribute must type key differences er model relational model following points explain main differences er model relational model main distinction er model relational model er model describes relationship entities attributes hand relational model referred implementation model relational model implementation representational model er model highlevel conceptual model data components entity sets relationship sets attributes represented er model relational model hand defines data components tuples attributes attribute domains compared relational model er model makes easier understand relationships entities mapping cardinality always constraint er model cardinality constraint cannot defined relational model er model vs relational model comparison chart following comparison chart explains main differences quick manner comparison basis er model relational model basic its used describe set objects known entities well relationships its used represent collection tables well relationships type highlevel conceptual model implementation representational model components represents components entity entity type entity set represents components domain attributes tuples used model helpful people dont knowledge data implemented model mostly famous among programmers relationship easy understand relationship entities compared er model easier derive relation tables relational model mapping model explains map cardinalities uniqueness data values row referred cardinality model describe mapping cardinalities conclusion article made comparison er model relational model we may conclude convert er model relational model must ensure strong entity table next topicdbms sql introduction prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please
