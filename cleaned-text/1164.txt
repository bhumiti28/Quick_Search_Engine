protein synthesis next prev lysosome tiny circular membranebound cell organelle enclosed membrane contains acidic digestive enzymes hydrolase enzymes lysosome discovered christian de duve liver cells term lysosome name suicide bags lysosomes also given de duve found eukaryotic cells except fungi like yeast neurospora also absent protists like euglena meristematic cells mature mammalian rbcs also known scavenger cells digests unwanted debris residues left cell number lysosomes number lysosomes cell varies cell cell example cells involved intracellular digestion activity contain number lysosomes white blood cells wbcs phagocytes ingest digest harmful foreign particles similarly osteoclasts lysosomes digest old bone cells also helps replacing cartilage bony material structure lysosomes dont specific shape structure pleomorphic cell organelles means change shape depending functions however generally globular granular shape diameter lysosome ranges micrometre bounded single lipoprotein made lipids proteins bilayer membrane similar plasma membrane besides glycosylated lysosomal associated membrane proteins lamp lysosomal integral membrane proteins limp present membrane proteins form layer inner side membrane protect membrane damaging effect hydrolytic enzymes present matrix lysosome size lysosome generally spherical shape bounded membrane also matrix material inside lysosome based type nature matrix present lysosome four types so also polymorphic organelle exist different forms types types lysosomes primary lysosomes inactive hydrolytic enzymes also known storage granules store chemicals required cell degrade materials enzymes found primary lysosomes synthesized ribosomes located rough endoplasmic reticulum stored endoplasmic reticulum er from er transferred golgi body form vesicles covered membrane primary lysosome contains one type enzymes whereas secondary lysosome contains different types hydrolytic enzymes ii secondary lysosomes contain active hydrolytic enzymes phagocytic vacuole phagosome carry phagocytosis present cytoplasm form autophagic vacuole cytolysosome performs autophagy selfdestruction example digestive vacuole heterophagosomes phagosome formed foreign material engulfed cell phagocytosis pinocytosis body containing engulfed material associated primary lysosome lysosome cell fuses phagosome form phagolysosomes secondary lysosome after fusion engulfed material phagosome digested hydrolytic enzymes lysosome undigested waste released cell membrane rate digestion phagosome depends nature amount material engulfed phagosome digestion produces simpler molecules low molecular weight passes membrane lysosome may secreted cell useful stay cytoplasm used cell iii tertiary lysosomes also known residual bodies contain undigested material left digestion absorption food particles so lysosomes containing undigested material left due incomplete digestion iv autophagosomes also known autolysosomes carry digestion internal parts cell example old damaged infected mitochondria cell digested type lysosome so also digestive enzymes uses enzymes digest unwanted internal parts cell sometimes old cell needs digested autophagosomes rupture inside cell enzymes released entire cell digested due reason lysosomes also known suicidal bags cell similarly autophagic vacuole engulfs wornout parts cell digest however destroy digest entire cell first three types lysosomes also known heterophagosomes involved digestion intracellular structures digest outside particles engulf like food particles pathogens etc so internal structure shape lysosomes may vary polymorphism due presence different types chemicals due association primary lysosome different materials engulfed digested cell origin lysosomes lysosomes originate different ways based tissue located function specific cell pinocytic vacuole formed engulfing liquid so extracellular origin may enclosures contain leftovers digested material may originate golgi complex common method origin chemistry lysosome lysosome contains around types digestive hydrolytic enzymes break digest large number molecules body rich acid hydrolase its enzymes work best acidic ph maintain acidity matrix lysosome hydrogen ions continuously pumped lysosome so average ph inside lysosome makes acidic cytoplasm ph besides certain enzymes found lysosomes oxidative enzymes like dehydrogenase cytochrome oxidase when membrane lysosome ruptures enzymes released become active enzymes remain inactive long membrane remains intact undergo change coming contact cellular structures types enzymes lysosomes generally six categories types enzymes present lysosomes listed proteases digest break proteins nucleases digest nucleic acids dna rna example dnase rnase glycosidases break glycosidic bond esterases help breakdown ester bonds phosphatases help breakdown phosphate bonds sulfatases help breakdown sulphate bonds some major enzymes found lysosome follows acid ribonuclease breaks rna acid deoxyribonuclease breaks dna acid phosphate breaks phosphate monoesters phosphoprotein phosphatase break phosphoproteins cathepsin b break polypeptides collagenase break collagen functions lysosomes performs intracellular digestion membrane fuses food vacuole membrane transfers enzymes inside vacuole digested food moves vacuole membrane used growth energy cell performs autolysis digests cell organelle entire cell auto phagosomes ruptured enzymes released dead cells aging cells damaged cells malfunctioned organelles digest also performs heterophagy extracellular digestion digests outside material may pathogens food particles harmful substances etc secretes hydrolases enzymes extracellular environment exocytosis thus also break extracellular material also called digestive bags also performs autophagy digests internal food reserves acrosome sperm head also contains lysosomal enzymes ruptures releases enzymes eggs surface carry fertilization also help destroy carcinogens cancercausing substances also performs regression tadpole tail development tadpole cells lymphocytes breakdown lysosomes may activate mitosis so also plays role cell division so mainly responsible breakdown complex substances simpler substances we say waste disposable system body cells digests bacteria viruses wornout cell organelle furthermore lysosome important cell organelle work properly may cause certain diseases tay sachs disease occurs due accumulation lipids brain cells may lead mental retardation next topicperoxisome prev next videos join
