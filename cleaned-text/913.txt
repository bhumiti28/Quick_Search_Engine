described interface among computer hardware user computer group software handles resources computer hardware facilitates basic services computer programs operating system essential component system software within computer system primary aim operating system provide platform user run program conveniently efficiently hand linux os one famous versions unix os developed provide lowcost free os several personal computer system users remarkably complete os including x window system emacs editor iptcp gui graphical user interface etc linux operating system history linux history started starting particular project finland student linus torvalds creating new free os kernel final linux kernel remarked continuous development throughout history since linux proposed finland student linus torvalds hpux hewlett packard version published hewlett packard version published freebsd version netbsd version released red hat linux proposed caldera detected ransom love bryan sparks netbsd version published hpux version freebsd version released k desktop environment established matthias ettrich hpux version released irix version ie fifth sgi unix generation free bsd version sun solaris os released caldera system agreement professional services division sco server software division released linus torvalds published linux version source code microsoft filed trademark collection lindowscom lindows name modified linspire first publication ubuntu published opensuse project started free distribution community novell oracle published red hat distribution dell begun laptop distribution ubuntu preinstalled linux kernel version released linuxbased android google insisted market share smartphone based number phones exported ubuntu insisted users architecture linux system linux operating systems architecture mainly contains components kernel system library hardware layer system shell utility kernel kernel one core section operating system responsible major actions linux os operating system contains distinct types modules cooperates underlying hardware directly kernel facilitates required abstraction hiding details lowlevel hardware application programs system important kernel types mentioned monolithic kernel micro kernels exo kernels hybrid kernels system libraries libraries specified special functions applied implementing operating systems functionality dont need code access rights modules kernel system utility programs responsible specialized level individual activities hardware layer linux operating system contains hardware layer consists several peripheral devices like cpu hdd ram shell interface among kernel user afford services kernel take commands user runs functions kernel shell available distinct types oses operating systems categorized two different types graphical shells commandline shells graphical line shells facilitate graphical user interface command line shells facilitate command line interface thus shells implement operations however graphical user interface shells work slower compared commandline interface shells types shells categorized follows korn shell bourne shell c shell posix shell linux operating system features some primary features linux os follows portable linux os perform different types hardware kernel linux supports installation type hardware environment open source linux operating system source code available freely enhancing capability linux os several teams performing collaboration multiprogramming linux os defined multiprogramming system means one application executed time multiuser linux os also defined multiuser system means one user use resources system application programs memory ram time hierarchical file system linux os affords typical file structure user files system files arranged security linux os facilitates user security systems help various features authentication controlled access specific files password protection data encryption shell linux operating system facilitates unique interpreter program type program applied executing commands operating system applied perform various types tasks call application programs others drawbacks linux hardware drivers most users linux face issue using linux various companies hardware prefer build drivers mac windows due contain several users linux linux small drivers peripheral hardware windows software alternative lets take photoshop example famous tool graphic editing photoshop exists windows however available linux also tools photo editing photoshop tool powerful compare others another example ms office present linux users learning curve linux isnt userfriendly operating system hence might confusing many beginners getting begun windows efficient easy many beginners however understanding linux working complex we understand command line interface finding newer software little bit complex well when face issue os searching solution problematic also various experts mac windows compare linux games several games developed windows unfortunately linux because platform windows used widely so developers games interested windows linux operating system applications linux billiondollar corporation nowadays thousands governments companies using linux operating system across world lower money time licensing fee affordability linux used within several types electronic devices electronic devices easily available users worldwide famous linuxbased electronic devices listed yamaha motive keyboard volvo incar navigation system tivo digital video recorder sony reader sony bravia television one laptop per child xo motorola motorokr em phone lenovo ideapad s hp mini google android dev phone garmin nuvi dell inspiron mini linux distribution os composed softwarebased collection linux kernel say distribution includes linux kernel supporting software libraries we obtain linuxbased os downloading linux distribution types distributions exists distinct types devices personal computers embedded devices etc around linux distributions existed famous linux distributions listed follows deepin opensuse fedora solus debian ubuntu elementary linux mint manjaro mx linux ubuntu linux differ yes primary difference window linux window open source free os linux distribution based debian whereas linux large collection opensource oses working based linux kernel besides ubuntu distribution linux linux core system ubuntu integrated canonical ltd published linux integrated linus torvalds published user mode vs kernel mode code kernel component runs unique privilege mood known kernel mode along complete access every computer resource code illustrates individual process runs individual address space dont need context switch hence fast efficient kernel executes processes facilitates various services system processes also facilitates secured access processes hardware support code needed execute kernel mode inside system library user programs types system programs implemented user mode includes access kernel mode system hardware user utilitiesprograms use system libraries accessing kernel functions obtain lowlevel tasks system next topiclinux lite prev next videos join our youtube
