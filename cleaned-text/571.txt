concepts iot our internet things tutorial designed beginners professionals iot stands internet things means accessing controlling daily usable equipments devices using internet our iot tutorial includes topics iot introduction features advantage disadvantage ecosystem decision framework architecture domains biometric security camera door unlock system devices etc what internet things iot lets us look closely mobile device contains gps tracking mobile gyroscope adaptive brightness voice detection face detection etc components individual features communicate provide better environment example phone brightness adjusted based gps location direction connecting everyday things embedded electronics software sensors internet enabling collect exchange data without human interaction called internet things iot term things internet things refers anything everything day day life accessed connected internet iot advanced automation analytics system deals artificial intelligence sensor networking electronic cloud messaging etc deliver complete systems product services system created iot greater transparency control performance platform cloud contains data connect things around us example house connect home appliances air conditioner light etc things managed platform since platform connect car track fuel meter speed level also track location car common platform things connect would great based preference i set room temperature example i love room temperature set degree celsius i reach back home office according car location ac would start minutes i arrive home done internet things iot how internet thing iot work working iot different different iot echo system architecture however key concept working similar entire working process iot starts device smartphones digital watches electronic appliances securely communicate iot platform platforms collect analyze data multiple devices platforms transfer valuable data applications devices features iot important features iot works connectivity analyzing integrating active engagement many some listed connectivity connectivity refers establish proper connection things iot iot platform may server cloud after connecting iot devices needs high speed messaging devices cloud enable reliable secure bidirectional communication analyzing after connecting relevant things comes realtime analyzing data collected use build effective business intelligence good insight data gathered things call system smart system integrating iot integrating various models improve user experience well artificial intelligence iot makes things smart enhances life use data example coffee machine whose beans going end coffee machine order coffee beans choice retailer sensing sensor devices used iot technologies detect measure change environment report status iot technology brings passive networks active networks without sensors could hold effective true iot environment active engagement iot makes connected technology product services active engagement endpoint management important endpoint management iot system otherwise makes complete failure system example coffee machine order coffee beans goes end happens orders beans retailer present home days leads failure iot system so must need endpoint management iot index iot tutorial iot tutorial advantage disadvantage embedded devices system iot ecosystem iot
