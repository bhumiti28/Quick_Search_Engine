testing interview next prev frontend testing vs backend testing section going see difference frontend testing backend testing frontend backend mostly used technical teams computer industry generally webbased application threetier architecture application first layer presentation layer known frontend third layer database layer known backend what frontend testing type software testing used evaluate presentation layer threetier architecture web application web application frontend testing include analysis multiple components menus graphs forms reports related javascript word frontend testing used covers diversity testing approaches execute frontend testing test engineer required good knowledge business necessities executed either manually help automation tools fundamentally performed ui user interface also known presentation layer threetier architecture what backend testing another part software testing backend testing used test application database layer tier architecture web application essentially order perform backend testing require gui graphical user interface achieved aui application user interface database thats pass data directly browsers help parameters needed specific function retrieve response nearly predefined format xml json we also connect database directly validate data help sql commands test backend application layers go backend testing after seeing brief introduction frontend backend testing understand comparison difference frontend testing backend testing table listed important differences frontend backend testing sno frontend testing backend testing executed presentation layer tier architecture performed application database layer tier architecture always performed graphical user interface gui always implemented application user interface aui while performing frontend testing require store information database while performing backend testing need store data database understanding requirements necessary order execute frontend testing understanding database essential execute backend testing analyze overall capabilities application analyze deadlock data corruption data loss guibased frontend testing resources centrally achieved cloud computing aui based backend testing resources executed collaboration pattern grid computing knowledge automation frameworks tools like qtp selenium mandatory perform frontend testing knowledge sql structured query language language concepts compulsory implement backend testing frontend testing includes verification application checks performance application whether working according requirement backend testing execution makes sure data continuing performance hit system testing acceptance testing unit testing accessibility testing regression testing performed frontend testing database testing api testing sql testing performed backend testing just like types testing frontend testing also contains tools follows livereload karma grunt execute backend testing tools available market follows dtm data generator turbodata data factory conclusion tutorial made difference frontend backend testing conclude testings play significant role software testing frontend testing contains html js css images whereas backend testing contains business logic testing database testing frontend backend testing different activities implemented developers work ends line finally say frontend
