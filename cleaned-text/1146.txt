jenkins interview next jenkins tutorial jenkins tutorial designed beginners professionals our tutorial provides basic advanced concepts jenkins jenkins installation jenkins configuration jenkins pipeline etc jenkins open source automation tool written java programming language allows continuous integration jenkins builds tests software projects continuously making easier developers integrate changes project making easier users obtain fresh build what jenkins jenkins open source automation tool written java programming language allows continuous integration jenkins builds tests software projects continuously making easier developers integrate changes project making easier users obtain fresh build also allows us continuously deliver software integrating large number testing deployment technologies jenkins offers straightforward way set continuous integration continuous delivery environment almost combination languages source code repositories using pipelines well automating routine development tasks help jenkins organizations speed software development process automation jenkins adds development lifecycle processes kinds including build document test package stage deploy static analysis much jenkins achieves ci continuous integration help plugins plugins used allow integration various devops stages want integrate particular tool install plugins tool example maven project git html publisher amazon ec etc example organization developing project jenkins continuously test project builds show errors early stages development possible steps executed jenkins example perform software build using build system like gradle maven apache execute shell script archive build result running software tests work flow history jenkins kohsuke kawaguchi java developer working sun microsystems tired building code fixing errors repetitively created automation server called hudson automates build test task oracle owned sun microsystems dispute hudson open source community forked hudson renamed jenkins both hudson jenkins continued operate independently short span time jenkins acquired lot contributors projects hudson remained projects time jenkins became popular hudson maintained anymore what continuous integration continuous integration ci development practice developers needs commit changes source code shared repository regular intervals every commit made repository built allows development teams detect problems early continuous integration requires developers regular builds general practice whenever code commit occurs build triggered continuous integration jenkins lets consider scenario complete source code application built deployed test server testing sounds like perfect way develop software process many problems developer teams wait till complete software developed test results high prospect test results might show multiple bugs tough developers locate bugs check entire source code application slows software delivery process continuous feedback pertaining things like architectural coding issues build failures test status file release uploads missing due quality software go whole process manual increases threat frequent failure obvious stated problems software delivery process became slow quality software also went leads customer dissatisfaction so overcome problem need system exist developers continuously trigger build test every change made source code continuous integration ci jenkins mature continuous integration tool available let us see continuous integration jenkins overcame shortcomings lets see generic flow diagram continuous integration jenkins lets see jenkins works diagram representing following functions first developer commits code source code repository meanwhile jenkins checks repository regular intervals changes soon commit occurs jenkins server finds changes occurred source code repository jenkins draw changes start preparing new build build fails concerned team notified built successful jenkins server deploys built test server after testing jenkins server generates feedback notifies developers build test results continue verify source code repository changes made source code whole process keeps repeating advantages disadvantages using jenkins advantages jenkins open source tool free cost require additional installations components means easy install easily configurable supports plugins ease work plugin exist write script share community built java hence portable platform independent available platforms different operating systems like os x windows linux easy support since open source widely used jenkins also supports cloud based architecture deploy jenkins cloud based platforms disadvantages jenkins its interface dated user friendly compared current user interface trends easy maintain runs server requires skills server administrator monitor activity ci regularly breaks due small setting changes ci paused therefore requires developers team attention jenkins architecture jenkins follows masterslave architecture manage distributed builds architecture slave master communicate tcpip protocol jenkins architecture two components jenkins masterserver jenkins slavenodebuild server jenkins master main server jenkins jenkins master web dashboard nothing powered war file default runs port help dashboard configure jobsprojects build takes place nodesslave default one node slave configured running jenkins server we add nodes using ip address user name password using ssh jnlp webstart methods servers job masters job handle scheduling build jobs dispatching builds nodesslaves actual execution monitor nodesslaves possibly taking online offline required recording presenting build results masterserver instance jenkins also execute build jobs directly jenkins slave jenkins slave used execute build jobs dispatched master we configure project always run particular slave machine particular type slave machine simple let jenkins pick next available slavenode know jenkins developed using java platform independent thus jenkins masterservers slavenodes configured servers including linux windows mac diagram self explanatory consists jenkins master managing three jenkins slaves prerequisite before learning jenkins basic understanding testing java audience our jenkins tutorial designed help beginners professionals problems we
