gradle tutorial javatpoint home java gradle groovy android c c c kotlin javascript xml ajax sql html quiz forum gradle tutorial gradle tutorial gradle installation gradle vs maven gradle vs ant gradle vs jenkins eclipse plugin gradle build gradle dependencies gradle repository projects tasks gradle build scans gradle wrapper gradle multiproject builds gradle java application next gradle tutorial gradle tutorial provides basic advanced concepts gradle tool our gradle tutorial developed beginners professionals our gradle tutorial includes project task installation configuration gradle build gradle build scans gradle dependencies gradle projects gradle eclipse plugin gradle java gradle spring gradle android concepts related gradle gradle advanced generalpurpose build management tool based groovy kotlin build automation tool opensource based concepts apache maven apache ant developed multiprojects quite large developed building automation many languages platforms including java scala android c c groovy what gradle gradle open source build automation tool based concept apache maven apache ant capable building almost type software designed multiproject build quite large introduces java groovybased dsldomain specific language instead xml extensible markup language declaring project configuration uses dag directed acyclic graph define order executing task gradle offers elastic model help development lifecycle compiling packaging code web mobile applications provides support building testing deploying software different platforms developed building automation many languages platforms including java scala android c c groovy gradle provides integration several development tools servers including eclipse intellij jenkins android studio gradle used large projects spring projects hibernate projects grails projects some leading enterprise companies like linkedin netflix use gradle gradle initially released stably released november latest version gradle taken advantages ant maven remove drawbacks what build tool build tools programs used automate creation executable applications source code building process involves compiling linking packaging code useful executable form developers often implement build process manually small projects cannot done large projects complicated keep track needed construction order dependencies building process using automation tools makes build process consistent projects tasks gradle gradle describes everything basis projects tasks every gradle build contains one projects projects contain tasks gradle projects gradle project represents library jar web application may also represent distribution zip assembled jars produced projects project could deploying application staging production environments each project gradle made one tasks gradle tasks gradle task single piece work build performs example could compile classes create jar generate javadoc publish archives repository features gradle some remarkable features gradle follows high performance gradle quickly completes task reusing output previous execution processes tasks whose input changed executes task parallel thus avoids unnecessary tasks provides faster performance free opensource gradle opensource tool licensed apache license asl provide support ant tasks maven repositories gradle provides support ant build projects import ant build project reuse tasks however also make antbased gradle tasks integration includes properties paths gradle supports maven repository maven repositories designed publish fetch dependencies project therefore continue use available repository infrastructure multiproject build support gradle provides powerful support multiproject builds multiproject build may contain root project one subprojects may also subprojects we flexibly define layout gradle project simply dependent projects dependencies we describe graph dependencies among projects gradle also supports partial builds means gradle find whether project upon project depends needs rebuilt project needs rebuilt gradle building project extensibility extensibility one decent features gradle we easily extend gradle provide task types build models example see android build support adds several new build concepts flavor builds types incremental builds gradle facilitates us incremental build means executes necessary tasks compile source code check sources changed since previous execution code changed executed code changed skip execution task marked updated many algorithms gradle familiar java we need jvm run gradle machine java development kit jdk gradle familiar java features bonus java users use standard java apis build logic plugins custom tasks therefore makes easy run gradle different platforms gradle isnt limited building jvm projects also provides support building native projects ide support gradle support several ides allowed import gradle builds interact gradle also generates required solution files load project visual studio build scans build scans provides comprehensive information build run used identify build issues also help us diagnose problems builds performance build scans shared others useful need advice fix issue build advantages gradle some significant benefits gradle following highly customizable gradle highly customizable extensible customized different projects different technologies customized many ways like used java projects android projects groovy projects performance gradle fast performance two times faster maven scenarios hundred times faster large builds using buildcache flexibility gradle flexible tool gradle plugin based build tool we create plugin different programming language like java groovy kotlin scala want add functionality deployment project create plugin give control codebase user experience gradle supports wide range ides provide improved user experience most people prefer work ide many users prefer work terminal gradle provides commandline interface gradle commandline interface offers many powerful features like gradle tasks command line completion also provides interactive webbased ui debugging optimizing builds gradle generalpurpose build tool gradle generalpurpose build tool allows us build type software why gradle gradle modern build tool comes thinking challenges faced tools like ant maven build tool help us accomplish goal automating project therefore compromise maintainability usability flexibility extendibility performance developed overcome drawbacks maven ant supports wide range ides features lots plugins written prediction also used large projects spring projects hibernate projects grails projects so may right choice us choose gradle build tool prerequisite before learning gradle must basic knowledge java programming groovy
