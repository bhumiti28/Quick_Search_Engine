multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types angles many types shapes used study purposes geometry angle one several types angles geometry help structure complex geometrical shapes figures structures eventually help study geometrical fundamentals angles also play crucial role reallife activities architects engineers use different angles designing buildings bridges roads machinery etc many applications angles daily life therefore essential know different angles take advantage daytoday activities before discuss various angle types let us first understand fundamentals characteristics angles what angle when two rays lines intersect point angle angles formed intersection usually amount turn common point two rays follow various fashions intersect form different angles angles measured degrees note name angle originated latin word angulus parts angle three essential parts required form angle vertex corner point angle known vertex vertex arms angle meet arms two straight lines sides forming vertex called arms arms also divided initial side vertical side terminal side angle angle refers rotation turn arms words arms rotated meeting point measure rotation known angle types angles various types angles based different measurements however angles typically categorized based following two measurements based magnitude based rotation let us discuss type detail classification angles based magnitude based degree measurement magnitude angles usually divided following types zero angle acute angle right angle obtuse angle straight angle reflex angle complete angle what zero angle zero angle refers angle formed angles arms direction position typically angle formed position therefore known zero angle measured zero degrees following diagram represents arms pr pq position angle formed zero angle ie rpq zero angle what acute angle acute angle defined angle lies more specifically angle less example acute angle examples etc following diagrams illustrate acute angles angle diagram greater less what right angle right angle refers angle equal degrees angle neither less degrees right angle typically formed two arms lines angle intersect perpendicularly angle formed usually represented creating squareshaped box arms angle near vertex following diagrams examples right angles angle diagram precisely equal what obtuse angle obtuse angle opposite acute angle obtuse angle usually defined angle lies words every angle greater less example obtuse angle examples etc following diagrams examples obtuse angles angle diagram greater less what straight angle straight angle mixture acute angle obtuse angle line simple terms two arms angle opposite direction making straight line angle formed arms called straight angle name straight angle used straight line straight angle exactly equal degrees essential neither less degrees following diagram represents arms pr pq opposite direction angle formed straight angle ie rpq straight angle what reflex angle reflex angle angle formed straight angle degrees whole turn terminal arm side simple terms reflex angle refers angle lies words every angle greater less example reflex angle examples etc following diagrams examples reflex angles angle diagram greater less what complete angle complete angle angle equal angle neither less degrees complete angle typically formed one two arms turns completely taking complete rotation base position form angle words angle one revolution one whole turn equal degrees also known full rotation angle full angle following diagram represents angles arm making whole turn thus name complete angle angle formed complete angle ie complete angle classification angles based rotation based directionmeasurement direction rotation angles mainly divided positive angles negative angles what positive angles positive angles defined angles measured counterclockwise direction direction opposite clockwise base position origin most time positive angles used geometry represent angles study purposes angles drawn x y plane origin following examples positive angles angle goes counterclockwise base position what negative angles negative angles opposite positive angles means angles measured clockwise direction base negative angles angles drawn x y plane base position following examples negative angles angle goes clockwise base position other types angles apart angles mentioned types angles angles formed joining two angles making whole new form angle because angles appear pairs also termed pair angles following types angles formed pair angles adjacent angles linear pair complementary angles supplementary angles adjacent angles when two angles connected way common vertex one common arm termed adjacent angles moreover noncommon arm connected angles lies opposite sides common arm following diagrams examples adjacent angles common vertex one common arm noncommon arm lying either side common arm complementary angles when measuring sum two angles adds termed complementary angles compulsory adjacent angles called complementary angles long two angles add degrees complementary angles following diagrams examples complementary angles diagrams two angles add measure seen diagram diagram b adjacent angles angles add degrees also called complementary angles besides diagrams c d adjacent however angles also add degrees called complementary angles supplementary angles supplementary angles similar complementary angles however one big difference two angles always add measure degrees supplementary angles instead degrees like complementary angles following diagrams illustrate supplementary angles two angles diagram add measure supplementary angles subdivided following types vertical angles vertical angles refer angles formed using common vertex sides arms vertical angles measured exactly equal sometimes termed vertically opposite angles following diagram represents vertical angles here angles vertical angles similarly angles also vertical angles interior exterior angles consider diagram two parallel lines crossed third line called transversal look like diagram given here clear total angles diagram angles vertical angles common vertex arms besides angles formed internal parts called interior angles diagram angles denoted interior angles way angles formed external parts called exterior angles here angles examples exterior angles let us understand angles considering diagram alternate interior angles alternate interior angles refer pair interior angles formed opposite third line transversal simplest method find alternate interior angles consider z interior sides diagram angles angles examples alternate interior angles angles remain exactly equal ie alternate exterior angles alternate exterior angles follow rules interior angles external parts simple terms alternate exterior angles refer pair exterior angles formed opposite third line transversal diagram angles angles examples alternate exterior angles like alternate interior angles alternate exterior angles also equal corresponding angles corresponding angles refer pair angles present similar position corresponding angles also equal diagram angles angles angles angles corresponding angles also equal etc linear pair when noncommon arms adjacent angle exactly opposite form linear pair angle essential note noncommon arms together make straight line following diagrams illustrate linear pair angles here diagram noncommon arms form straight line next topictypes cell prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share
