github git vs svn git vs mercurial version control system getting started install git windows install git linux install git mac git environment setup git tools git terminology git commands git flow cheat sheet git cheat sheet staging commits git init git add git commit git clone git stash git ignore git fork git repository git index git head git origin master git remote git tags upstream downstream undoing changes git checkout git revert git reset git rm git cherrypick inspecting changes git log git diff git status branching merging git branch merge merge conflict git rebase git squash collaborating git fetch git pull git push interview questions git interview next git tutorial git tutorial provides basic advanced concepts git github our git tutorial designed beginners professionals git modern widely used distributed version control system world developed manage projects high speed efficiency version control system allows us monitor work together team members workspace tutorial help understand distributed version control system git via command line well github examples tutorial performed windows also perform operations operating systems like linux ubuntu macos what git git opensource distributed version control system designed handle minor major projects high speed efficiency developed coordinate work among developers version control allows us track work together team members workspace git foundation many services like github gitlab use git without using git services git used privately publicly git created linus torvalds develop linux kernel also used important distributed versioncontrol tool devops git easy learn fast performance superior scm tools like subversion cvs perforce clearcase features git some remarkable features git follows open source git opensource tool released gpl general public license license scalable git scalable means number users increases git easily handle situations distributed one gits great features distributed distributed means instead switching project another machine create clone entire repository also instead one central repository send changes every user repository contains entire commit history project we need connect remote repository change stored local repository necessary push changes remote repository security git secure uses sha secure hash function name identify objects within repository files commits checked retrieved checksum time checkout stores history way id particular commits depends upon complete development history leading commit once published one cannot make changes old version speed git fast complete tasks most git operations done local repository provides huge speed also centralized version control system continually communicates server somewhere performance tests conducted mozilla showed extremely fast compared vcss fetching version history locally stored repository much faster fetching remote server core part git written c ignores runtime overheads associated highlevel languages git developed work linux kernel therefore capable enough handle large repositories effectively from beginning speed performance gits primary goals supports nonlinear development git supports seamless branching merging helps visualizing navigating nonlinear development branch git represents single commit we construct full branch structure help parental commit branching merging branching merging great features git makes different scm tools git allows creation multiple branches without affecting we perform tasks like creation deletion merging branches tasks take seconds below features achieved branching we create separate branch new module project commit delete whenever want we production branch always goes production merged testing test branch we create demo branch experiment check working we also remove needed core benefit branching want push something remote repository push branches we select branches together data assurance git data model ensures cryptographic integrity every unit project provides unique commit id every commit sha algorithm we retrieve update commit commit id most centralized version control systems provide integrity default staging area staging area also unique functionality git considered preview next commit moreover intermediate area commits formatted reviewed completion when make commit git takes changes staging area make new commit we allowed add remove changes staging area staging area considered place git stores changes although git doesnt dedicated staging directory store objects representing file changes blobs instead uses file called index another feature git makes apart scm tools possible quickly stage files commit without committing modified files working directory maintain clean history git facilitates git rebase one helpful features git fetches latest commits master branch puts code top thus maintains clean history project benefits git version control application allows us keep track changes make files project every time make changes files existing project push changes repository other developers allowed pull changes repository continue work updates added project files some significant benefits using git follows saves time git lightning fast technology each command takes seconds execute save lot time compared login github account find features offline working one important benefits git supports offline working facing internet connectivity issues affect work git almost everything locally comparatively cvs like svn limited prefer connection central repository undo mistakes one additional benefit git undo mistakes sometimes undo savior option us git provides undo option almost everything track changes git facilitates exciting features diff log status allows us track changes check status compare files branches why git we discussed many features benefits git demonstrate undoubtedly git leading version control system now discuss points choose git git integrity git developed ensure security integrity content version controlled uses checksum transit tampering file system confirm information lost internally creates checksum value contents file verifies transmitting storing data trendy version control system git widely used version control system maximum projects among version control systems due amazing workflow features preferred choice developers everything local almost all operations git performed locally significant reason use git we ensure internet connectivity collaborate public projects many public projects available github we collaborate projects show creativity world many developers collaborating public projects collaboration allows us stand experienced developers learn lot thus takes programming skills next level impress recruiters we impress recruiters mentioning git github resume send github profile link hr organization want join show skills influence work increases chances getting hired prerequisites git
