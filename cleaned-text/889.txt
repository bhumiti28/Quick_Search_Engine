stateoftheart deep learning models how build larger models image text data how use advanced image augmentation techniques order lift model performance indepth introduction keras deep learning library how develop evaluate neural network models endtoend how serialize models disk requirements basic understanding programming python familiarity machine learning process description mikes courses popular many clients josh gordon developer advocate google welcome handson keras machine learning engineers course guide deep learning python keras you discover keras python library deep learning use develop evaluate deep learning models two top numerical platforms developing deep learning models theano developed university montreal tensorflow developed google both developed use python leveraged super simple use keras library keras wraps numerical computing complexity theano tensorflow providing concise api use develop neural network deep learning models keras become gold standard applied space rapid prototyping deep learning models my name mike west im machine learning engineer applied space ive worked consulted companies finished project microsoft ive published courses udemy youre interested learning realworld really like youre good hands who course course developers machine learning engineers data scientists want learn get keras you need machine learning expert would helpful knew navigate small machine learning problem using scikitlearn basic concepts like crossvalidation one hot encoding used lessons projects described briey mind entry level course keras library what going learn how develop evaluate neural network models endtoend how use advanced techniques required developing stateoftheart deep learning models how build larger models image text data how use advanced image augmentation techniques order lift model performance how get help deep learning python anatomy keras model evaluate performance deep learning keras model build endto end regression classification models keras how use checkpointing save best model run how reduce overtting dropout regularization how enhance performance learning rate schedules work crash course convolutional neural networks course hands onguide playbook workbook intended learn apply new understanding deep learning keras models get course i would recommend working examples tutorial watch course like movie youll get little applied space machine learning programming programming hands onsport thank interest handson keras machine learning engineers lets get started who course want need learn keras deep learning
