protein synthesis next prev cytoskeleton cytoskeleton refers cytoplasmic structures provide mechanical support shape strength cell like human skeletal provides human body structures made proteins minute fibrous filamentous tubular we say cytoskeleton network protein fibres cytoplasm acts structural framework cell thus provides stability cell well helps cell movement made different types proteins tubulin actin myosin tropomyosin keratin cytoskeleton unique feature eukaryotic cells present eukaryotic cells absent prokaryotic cells bacteria flexible dynamic structure fixed shape shape may change different conditions environments various internal cellular structures like nucleus cell organelles able hold positions inside cell maintain safe distance due cytoskeleton major components cytoskeleton described microtubules small hollow tubes like structures made single type globular protein called tubulin found matrix eukaryotic cells structures help movement like cilia flagella also made microtubules also found basal granules aster rays axoneme sperm tail centriole spindle fibres take part cell division metaphase anaphase state cell division also made microtubule so play major role cell division microtubule arrangement centriole wall microtubule made globular protein tubulin tubulin protein dimeric made two subunits alphatubulin betatubulin proteins subunits threedimensional structure allows fit tightly dimers arranged longitudinal rows called protofilaments singular protofilaments wall microtubule made protofilaments tubulin proteins noncontractile nature spirally arranged form wall microtubules protofilament asymmetric alphatubulin one end betatubulin end average diameter microtubule nm where diameter lumen around nm so thickness wall around nm microtubule large may extend across length breadth cell one end microtubule known plus end terminated betatubulin subunit end known minus end terminated alphatubulin subunits polarity beneficial growth enables participate mechanical activities during growth microtubule individual dimers alpha beta subunit bind plus end dimers released minus end process continues helps maintain length microtubule functions microtubules give shape rigidity cell help formation spindle fibres cell division form cytoskeleton internal support framework cilia flagella help separation chromosomes anaphase stage cell division microtubules help intracellular transportation nutrients observed paramecium cilia made microtubule help move food gullet mouth paramecium microtubule also helps various cell movements including intracellular transport positioning membrane also helps secretory vesicles move cell ii intermediate filaments made different types proteins keratin desmin nestin vimentin length around nm length microtubule nm less length microfilament nm so called intermediate filaments stable provide shape mechanical strength nuclear membrane anchor cell organelles unlike components cytoskeleton take part cell motility functions intermediate filaments provide support cell may arranged meshlike pattern provide support different types cells help formation chromatin provides tensile strength structures present example hairs enable cells withstand mechanical stress stretched so prominent cells undergo mechanical stress example epithelial cells skin protect cells breaking due mechanical shear uniformly distributing effect localized stress iii microfilaments solid unbranched rodlike structures lumen inside found eukaryotic cells also known actin filaments thin compared parts cytoskeleton microfilaments made contractile proteins include actin myosin proteins strong well flexible thus useful cell movement actin globular protein whereas myosin filamentous protein functions microfilaments provide support plasma membrane acting framework plasm membrane thus helps maintain structure help movement contractile nature also help cell division making cleavage furrow contraction heart facilitated aid actinmyosin filaments microfilaments also found microvilli fingerlike projections present cell increase area absorption next topiccell membrane prev next videos join
