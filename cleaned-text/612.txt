search tree avl tree analysis algorithm set amortized analysis introduction difficulty level medium last updated mar amortized analysis used algorithms occasional operation slow operations faster amortized analysis analyze sequence operations guarantee worst case average time lower worst case time particular expensive operation example data structures whose operations analyzed using amortized analysis hash tables disjoint sets splay trees let us consider example simple hash table insertions how decide table size tradeoff space time make hashtable size big search time becomes slow space required becomes high solution tradeoff problem use dynamic table arrays idea increase size table whenever becomes full following steps follow table becomes full allocate memory larger table size typically twice old table copy contents old table new table free old table table space available simply insert new item available space what time complexity n insertions using scheme use simple analysis worst case cost insertion therefore worst case cost n inserts n analysis gives upper bound tight upper bound n insertions insertions dont take n time so using amortized analysis could prove dynamic table scheme o insertion time great result used hashing also concept dynamic table used vectors c arraylist java following important notes amortized cost sequence operations seen expenses salaried person average monthly expense person less equal salary person spend money particular month buying car something months saves money expensive month amortized analysis done dynamic array example called aggregate method two powerful ways amortized analysis called accounting method potential method we discussing two methods separate posts amortized analysis doesnt involve probability also another different notion averagecase running time algorithms use randomization make faster expected running time faster worstcase running time algorithms analyzed using randomized analysis examples algorithms randomized quick sort quick select hashing we soon covering randomized analysis different post amortized analysis insertion redblack tree let us discuss amortized analysis redblack tree operations insertion using potential method perform amortized analysis redblack tree insertion operation use potentialor physicists method potential method define potential function maps data structure nonnegative real value operation result change potential let us define potential function following manner n node redblack tree potential function nodes red black tree further define amortized time operation amortized time c h h h h h h states redblack tree operation respectively c actual cost operation change potential positive lowcost operations negative highcost operations new node inserted leaf redblack tree we leaves redblack tree one following types insertions amortized analysis represented insertion performed first recolouring parent siblingred grandparent uncle leaf node considered recolouring leads amortized cost when grandparent leaf node red uncle leaf black grandparent black uncle leaf red grandparent black insertion shown insertion node inserted without changes black depth leaves remain case leaf may black sibling sibling since consider colour colour null node black so amortized cost insertion insertion cannot recolour leaf node parent sibling black depth stays so need perform left left rotation after rotation changes grandparent gthe inserted node black also case red grandparent gthe inserted node changes so insertion completed amortized cost insertion depicted after calculating particular amortized costs leaf site redblack tree discuss nature total amortized cost insertion redblack tree since may happen two red nodes may parentchild relationship till root redblack tree so extremeor corner case reduce number black nodes two red children increase number black nodes red children leaving net loss potential function since one unit potential pays operation therefore h n n total number nodes thus total amortized cost insertion redblack tree doubts regarding insertions red black tree may refer insertions redblack tree sources
