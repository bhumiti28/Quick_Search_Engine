electronic cloud messaging etc deliver complete systems product services year worlds growing population estimated reached billion feed large population agriculture needs marry technology get best results agriculture another important domain iot iot systems play important role crop soil monitoring give proper solution accordingly iot leads smart farming using iot farmers minimize waste increase productivity system allows monitoring fields help sensors farmers monitor status area challenges modern agriculture industry challenges faced farming industry agriculture listed follows lack workforce manpower environmental challenges global warming requirement large manual intervention lack proper monitoring challenges analyzing large scale unstructured data various uses iot agriculture discussed follows iot analytics agriculture data smart sensors analyzed automated decisionmaking predictive analysis machine learning predictive analysis helpful farmers cope weather conditions drought flood etc dronebased uses drones also useful smart farming one side drones useful monitor soil air moisture quality another side also used physical activities prevention physical breakouts farms automated spraying fertilizers many although limitations using drone useful reduce manual workforce realtime crop monitoring motion detectors light detectors smartmotion sensing sensors smart sensors useful provide realtime data farmers farms helpful monitoring quality products smart irrigation system one parts smart agriculture using iot iot checks water lanes created farmer moisture level environment livestock management livestock requires regular monitoring smart tracking using iot helpful farmers get information stock directly smart devices helpful detect flu breakouts much earlier results separation noninfected breeds infected ones tank level monitoring iot helps remotely monitor level water tank configure alerts specific level reached smart greenhouse solutions usually greenhouses used maintaining required atmosphere plants process demands manual intervention continuous monitoring smart greenhouse designed using iot monitors controls climate intelligently also reduces requirement manual intervention adoption iot greenhouse costeffective increases accuracy eliminates human intervention instance solar power iot sensors build inexpensive modern greenhouses data analytics endtoend iot platform cloudbased data storage play vital role smart agriculture systems iot sensors primary source collecting data large scale using analytics tools data analyzed transformed meaningful information data analytics helps analysis crop conditions weather conditions livestock conditions agriculture iot helped farmers maintaining quality crops along use cases benefits benefits iot agriculture listed follows excellent efficiency cleaner process reduced resources expansion agility improved product quality infrastructure requirements infrastructure requirements adopting smart farming iot some requirements listed follows hardware maintenance cost continuous connectivity internet required high investments drones sensors requirement hire highly trained staff management
