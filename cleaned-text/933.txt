difference series parallel circuits series circuits refer circuit one path current flow series circuit components connected way fault happens circuit current flow circuit current series circuit throughout circuit hand parallel circuits refer circuit one path current flows parallel circuit components various branches current flow thus current throughout circuit read given tutorial know difference series parallel circuits what series circuit circuit said series circuit flow current throughout components circuit series circuits current single path series circuit relationships current voltage exact inverse parallel circuit current series element equal source current contrast voltage across series element v v v varies according impedance example resistance element kirchhoffs voltage law kvl applies voltage supplied source vs equal sum individual voltage drops across series element advantage series circuits simple design easy understand overheat quickly higher output voltage add power appliances carries current throughout circuit disadvantage series circuit total number components increases circuit circuit resistance fault occurs one point total circuit break now consider example series circuit understand concept find current flow resistor r r r given r ohm r ohm r ohm v v answer applying ohms law given circuit get v ir v i r r r i v r r r i i i amp what parallel circuit parallel circuit refers circuit two two paths current flow parallel circuit components voltage parallel circuit voltage across element equal source voltage vs current element i i i varies according impedance example resistance element kirchhoffs current law kcl applies total current flowing source equal sum individual currents flowing parallel element advantage parallel circuits parallel circuit one component gets damaged current stop continues flow components hence components work efficiently parallel circuit voltage across every component therefore components work efficiently parallel circuit easily connect disconnect new component without affecting working another component disadvantage parallel circuit parallel circuit cannot apply additional voltage source parallel circuit requires lots wires connection now consider example parallel circuit understand concept find total resistance points p q answer here ohm resistance connected parallel ohm resistor give ohm now ohm resistor connected series ohm resistance total resistance point p q ohm difference series parallel circuit series circuit parallel circuit circuit said series circuit flow current
