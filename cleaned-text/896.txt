article discuss complete overview enzyme types structure cofactors examples what enzyme enzymes biochemical polymers catalyze biochemical reactions enzyme biological catalyst always protein accelerates rate cell particular chemical reaction enzyme doesnt destroy reaction may reuse various times several different types enzyme molecules cell unique chemical reaction metabolic processs initial stage depends enzymes reacts molecule known substrate substrates converted distinct molecules enzymes called products enzyme control become key component clinical diagnosis significance maintaining life cycles proteins make macromolecular components enzymes except ribozymes rna catalysts name ribozyme comes ribonucleic acid enzyme structure enzyme enzymes proteins serve cellular metabolism affect catalyze reactions may used reverse reactions biochemical processes while enzymes complex enzyme structures undergo several necessary changes enzyme structure critical each reaction requires different enzyme enzymes composed amino acids connected linear chain amide bonds main structure resulting amino acid chain known protein polypeptide dna sequence corresponding gene encodes basic order amino acids polypeptide types enzymes mainly six types enzymes occur body biochemical reactions follows oxidoreductases lyases transferases hydrolases isomerases ligases oxidoreductases enzymes contribute reactions oxidation reduction also known oxidoreductases reactions move electrons type hydride ions hydrogen atoms substrate oxidized enzymes serve hydrogen donors enzymes called reductases dehydrogenases oxygen atom acceptor enzymes known oxidases lyases enzymes catalyze reactions functional groups added molecules break double bonds functional groups removed form double bonds transferases enzymes catalyze transition chemical group one compound next hydrolases enzymes catalyze reactions involving hydrolysis process known hydrolases break single bonds adding water save peptide bonds proteins hydrolases act digestive enzymes since move water molecule one compound another hydrolases may considered transferase form instance enzyme pepsin hydrolyzes peptide bonds proteins isomerases enzymes catalyze reactions functional group moved different location within molecule resulting essentially isomer original example triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase conversion phosphate glucose phosphate fructose ligases function enzymes opposite hydrolases ligases form bond removing water element hydrolases break bonds adding water various subclasses ligases include atp synthesis cofactors enzymes cofactors nonprotein compounds associated enzymes cofactor needed proper functioning enzyme enzyme without cofactor recognized apoenzyme holoenzyme combination enzyme cofactor enzyme three types cofactors prosthetic groups coenzyme metal ions prosthetic groups cofactors strongly bound enzyme time fad prosthetic group available several enzymes coenzyme coenzyme binds enzyme catalysis process times separated enzyme nad example coenzyme metal ions enzyme catalysis metal ion needed active site form coordination bonds zn cofactor metal ions used lots enzymes what factors affect enzyme activity various factors affect enzyme activity follows temperature each enzyme operates optimum temperature any change temperature influences enzymes activity causes denaturation inhibitors existence certain substances obstructs activity particular enzyme happens inhibitor bound enzymes active site preventing substrates attachment slowing process ph enzymes extremely sensitive ph changes operate within limited ph range theres risk enzymes disintegrate ph low high slowing reaction mechanism enzyme reaction any two molecules must collide reaction happen along proper orientation appropriate amount energy necessary energy molecules pass barrier reaction type energy known activation energy active site said exist enzymes active site binding reactant molecules part molecule definite shape functional group substrate group refers molecule connects enzyme when catalysts present substrate enzyme generate intermediate reaction reduced activation energy basic mechanism catalyze chemical reactions begin substrate binding enzymes active site active site mixture substrate specific zone examples enzymes various examples enzymes some follows amylase amylase enzyme helps turn starches sugars present human saliva certain mammals helps digest foods potatoes rice contain large amounts starch enzyme converts starch sugar making possible feel sweet taste person eats potatoes lipase lipase found living organisms essential absorption transport processing dietary lipids oils fats lactase small intestine also found split lactose sugar milk glucose galactose maltase also found saliva breaks sugars form glucose pancreas other enzymes renin used cheese making cellulases liginases help soften paper fabric softeners proteases lipases others used catalase helps transform latex rubber next topic prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest tutorials soapui rpa manual t cucumber
