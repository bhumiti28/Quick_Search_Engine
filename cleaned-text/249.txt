endoplasmic reticulum golgi body mitochondria lysosome peroxisome plastids ribosomes nucleus what dna dna structure nucleotide chromosome giant chromosomes what gene types genes genetic code codon protein synthesis next prev nucleus nucleus important cell organelle cell generally present centre cell contains hereditary genetic material cell thus plays vital role inheritance transfer traits parents offspring also controls growth reproduction various activities cell nucleus discovered robert brown he described structure nucleus orchid cells shape nucleus generally spherical circular shape however various shapes like oval shape smooth muscles squamous epithelial cells beanshaped string shaped may lobed different types white blood cells example acidophils bilobed nucleus basophils trilobed nucleus neutrophils multilobed nucleus besides nucleus horseshoeshaped found vorticella size nucleus size nucleus ranges micrometres micrometres however size may increase cell undergo cell division especially meiosis number nucleus one nucleus cell cells single nucleus called monokaryotic uninucleated cells whereas cells contain two nuclei called dikaryotic binucleated cells found paramecium cells two nuclei called coenocytic multinucleated cells eg opalina protozoan skeletal muscles fibres furthermore also certain cells living contain nucleus platelets sieve tubes plants mature red blood cells humans animals cells contain nucleus known enucleated cells besides movement nucleus cell fixed due sweeping movement cytoplasm position nucleus nucleus different positions cell listed centric centric nucleus generally located centre cell present eukaryotic cells ecentric position nucleus located away centre towards one side seen plant cells adipocytes peripheral nucleus present closer plasma membrane basal nucleus present towards base cell position nucleus found columnar cells structure nucleus nucleus surrounded enclosed doublelayered porous nuclear membrane nuclear envelope so double membrane bound structure space two membranes outer nuclear membrane inner nuclear membrane called perinuclear space outer nuclear membrane connected endoplasmic reticulum er also studded ribosomes largest cell organelle except translation steps gene expression dna replication occur only eukaryotic cells nucleus enclosed nuclear membrane whereas prokaryotic cells lacks nuclear membrane nuclear membrane continuous protein channels nuclear pores nuclear membrane allow certain molecules like rna move nucleus nuclear pores nuclear envelope average diameter nuclear pore angstrom furthermore number nuclear pores per unit area changes metabolic activities cell nuclear envelope including inner outer membrane known karyotheca pore complex inner outer nuclear membrane continuity periphery nuclear pores each pore octagonal shape pipelike octagonal structure lumen fitted pore ring pipelike structure called annulus annulus made vertical fibres lumen annulus filled nucleoplasmin entire structure pore area called pore complex controls movement transport materials nucleus cytoplasm vice versa so material required move cell move pore complex skeletal proteins called fibril lamina nuclear lamina present inner surface inner nuclear membrane protein mesh made electronrich proteins its main function provide mechanical support inner nuclear membrane nucleus nuclear membrane disappears mitosis meiosis mitosis disappears late prophase what nucleoplasm nucleus filled viscous fluid called nucleoplasm also called nuclear sap karyolymph keeps nucleus turgid contains material components required dna synthesis rna synthesis assemble dna chromosomes also contains regulatory proteins needed regulate cellular processes example enzymes dna replication divalent ions also present nucleoplasm mg mn ions act activators enzymes present nucleoplasm nucleoplasm also contains mrna trna rrna produced dense mass also present nucleus known nucleolus chromatin material complex dna protein also suspended nucleoplasm threadlike structures condense form chromosomes nucleolus nucleolus discovered fontana cells eel term nucleolus given bowman dense mass present nucleus associated nucleolus organizer region nor membrane however appears membrane outer part made nucleolar chromatin fibres arranged way appears nucleolus membrane amorphous material present inside nucleoplasm called pas amorpha pas amorpha granules rrna present so major function nucleolus formation storage rrna nucleolus disappears cell division formed cell division completed generally one cell one nucleolus however cells one nucleoli also reported example four nucleoli found nucleus onion cell chromosomes nucleus also houses chromosome made dna histone proteins chromosomes formed chromatin condensed organized start cell division when cell resting chromosomes remain entangled structures called chromatin functions nucleus acts control centre cell contains information form genes segments dna form chromosomes contains hereditary material dna carries information one generation another generation directs protein synthesis site dna transcription first step gene expression protein synthesis mrna produced its membrane helps cell compartmentalization separating contents cytoplasm processing newly formed mrna premrna occurs nucleus premrna undergo posttranscriptional modification molecules added removed leaves nucleus dna replication also occurs nucleus chromatins arranged chromosomes nucleus cell undergo cell division nuclear pores membrane allows selective transport molecules regulatory
