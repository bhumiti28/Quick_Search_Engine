protein synthesis next prev ribosomes ribosomes present prokaryotes eukaryotes although membrane generally considered cell organelle found mature sperms mature mammalian red blood cells rbcs look like tiny particles suspended cytoplasm attached embedded outer membrane rough endoplasmic reticulum nucleus ribosome basically complex made protein ribosomal rna contains made around equal amount ribosomal rna proteins due high content ribonucleic acid rna called ribosome also called ribonucleoprotein particle besides also known protein factories cell proteins formed surface ribosomes first isolated claude cytoplasm studied first time palade so also called palades particles term ribosome given roberts ribosome smallest organelle cell granular structure its size ranges angstrom angstrom discovered using electron microscope small compared organelles apart endoplasmic reticulum also found nucleus mitochondria plastids due reason also called organelle within organelle mitochondria known mitoribosomes plastids called plastidosomes cell located cytoplasm attached membrane cytoplasm known free ribosomes whereas membrane surface er nucleus called bound ribosomes structure ribosome two major parts made two subunits include small large ribosomal subunits subunits assembled joined together proteins ribosomal rna rrna during protein synthesis mrna binds smaller subunit information contained mrna decoded whereas larger subunit amino acids transferred trna arranged added previous amino acids form polypeptide chain proteins large subunit remains attached membrane help protein called ribophorin so always bound ribosome small subunit remains freely cytoplasm gets attached large subunit proteins synthesized when come together process called association mg helps association when protein synthesis gets completed subunits get separated known dissociation generally form helical groups active protein synthesis produce proteins ribosomes polysome held together mrna smaller subunit depression mrna binding site mrna binds protein synthesis whereas large subunit tunnel newly synthesized proteins passed endoplasmic reticulum er thus large subunit ribosome pushes newly synthesized polypeptide chain protect cellular enzymes also large subunit three sites asite amino acyl site acceptor site trna carrying amino acid landed psite peptidyl site donor site peptide bond formed amino acids esite exist site empty trna leaves ribosome types ribosomes based size sedimentation coefficient ribosomes two types s ribosomes s ribosomes s ribosome s found prokaryotic cells cell organelles like mitochondria plastids letters s svedbergs unit denotes density size ribosome nonsi metric unit sedimentation coefficient measures size particle based sedimentation rate acceleration means fast particle settles bottom solution s ribosome sedimentation coefficient s comparatively smaller s ribosomes prokaryotic cells freely located cytoplasm called monosomes subunits s prokaryotes s small subunit s large subunit furthermore s ribosomes rrna proteins so rrna protein besides three types rrna include s s s s s located large subunit whereas s rrna present small subunit s ribosome ii s ribosomes s ribosomes found eukaryotic cells eukaryotes its sedimentation coefficient s s small subunit s large subunit s ribosome made rrna proteins four types rrna include s s s s first three present larger subunit s last one s present small subunit s s ribosome two subunits normally remain separated join protein synthesized eukaryotes multiple ribosomes may attached mrna form polyribosomes polysomes so rate protein synthesis high polyribosomes where ribosomes formed ribosomes formed nucleolus come nuclear pores get attached surface endoplasmic reticulum present large number cells produce proteins pancreatic cells body produce lots digestive enzymes basically proteins functions ribosomes main function protein synthesis site place protein synthesis takes place proteins synthesized make proteins using rna amino acids decode information mrna accordingly produce proteins using amino acids cytoplasm so translate mrna polypeptide chains folded assembled proteins furthermore ribosomes take part metabolism lipids produce cytochrome electron transport cellular respiration also offer binding sites mrna trna loaded amino acids next topicnucleus prev next videos
