generalpurpose graphical modeling language field software engineering uml used specify visualize construct document artifacts major elements software system initially developed grady booch ivar jacobson james rumbaugh rational software development carried got adopted standard object management group what uml uml stands unified modeling language standardized generalpurpose visual modeling language field software engineering used specifying visualizing constructing documenting primary artifacts software system helps designing characterizing especially software systems incorporate concept object orientation describes working software hardware systems uml developed grady booch ivar jacobson james rumbaugh rational software got adopted standard object management group omg object management group omg association several companies controls open standard uml omg established build open standard mainly supports interoperability objectoriented systems restricted within boundaries also utilized modeling nonsoftware systems omg best recognized common object request broker architecture corba standards goals uml since generalpurpose modeling language utilized modelers uml came existence introduction objectoriented concepts systemize consolidate objectoriented development due absence standard methods time uml diagrams made business users developers ordinary people anyone looking forward understand system system software nonsoftware thus concluded uml simple modeling approach used model practical systems characteristics uml uml following features generalized modeling language distinct programming languages like c python etc interrelated objectoriented analysis design used visualize workflow system pictorial language used generate powerful modeling artifacts conceptual modeling before moving ahead concept uml first understand basics conceptual model conceptual model composed several interrelated concepts makes easy understand objects interact first step drawing uml diagrams following objectoriented concepts needed begin uml object object real world entity many objects present within single system fundamental building block uml class class software blueprint objects means defines variables methods common objects particular type abstraction abstraction process portraying essential characteristics object users hiding irrelevant information basically used envision functioning object inheritance inheritance process deriving new class existing ones polymorphism mechanism representing objects multiple forms used different purposes encapsulation binds data object together single unit enabling tight coupling oo analysis design oo analysis objects design means combining identified objects so main purpose oo analysis identifying objects designing system analysis also done existing system analysis efficient identify objects once identified objects relationships identified design also produced purpose oo given identify objects system identify relationships make design executable concepts oo employed following steps oo concepts applied implemented step oo analysis main purpose oo analysis identifying objects describing correctly after objects identified designing step easily carried must identify objects responsibilities here responsibility refers functions performed objects each individual object functions perform purpose system fulfilled collaborating responsibilities step oo design phase mainly emphasizes meeting requirements phase objects joined together per intended associations after association completed designing phase also gets complete step oo implementation last phase comes designing done implements design using oo languages like c java etc role uml oo design uml modeling language used model software well nonsoftware systems focuses modeling oo software applications essential understand relation oo design uml oo design converted uml required oo languages influence programming world model real world objects uml amalgamation objectoriented notations like objectoriented design ood object modeling technique omt objectoriented software engineering oose strength three approaches utilized uml represent consistency audience uml tutorial made beginners professionals help understand fundamental concept uml after completion tutorial find moderate level expertise take next level
