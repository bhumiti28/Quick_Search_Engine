mcq next prev bubble sort vs selection sort here look differences selection sort bubble sort before understanding differences know selection sort bubble sort individually what selection sort sorting means arranging elements array ascending order selection sort one sorting technique used sorting array selection sort array divided two sub arrays ie one unsorted subarray sorted subarray initially assume sorted subarray empty first find minimum element unsorted subarray swap minimum element element beginning position array algorithm named selection sort selecting minimum element performs swapping lets understand selection sort example observe array contains elements array unsorted array whose indexing starts ends following steps used sort array step array minimum element swap element element now sorted array contains one element ie unsorted array contains elements ie step unsorted subarray minimum element swap element element beginning unsorted subarray now sorted array contains two elements ie unsorted array four elements ie shown figure step search minimum element unsorted subarray minimum element swap element element beginning unsorted sub array now sorted array contains three elements ie unsorted array three elements ie step search minimum element unsorted array minimum element swap element element beginning unsorted subarray now sorted array contains four elements ie unsorted array two elements ie step search minimum element unsorted array minimum element swap element element beginning unsorted subarray now sorted array contains elements ie step last element left unsorted subarray move last element sorted sub array shown what bubble sort bubble sort also one sorting techniques used sorting elements array basic principle behind bubble sort two adjacent elements compared elements correct order move next iteration otherwise swap two elements lets understand bubble sort example consider array array unsorted array array consists integers ie following steps required used sort array pass step element compared element less ie swapping would done shown figure step now would compared element since greater element ie swap shown figure step would compared element since greater element ie swap elements shown figure step would compared element since greater ie swap elements shown figure observe array element largest bubbled correct position words say largest element placed last position array steps included pass largest element correct position we start comparing elements first position pass pass step first compare element since element greater element ie swap element shown figure step element would compared element greater ie swap element shown figure step element would compared element since greater element ie swap element element shown figure step now compared since less swapping would done shown figure observe two elements right position largest second largest element array three elements unsorted follow steps pass pass step first compare since less ie swapping would done shown figure step now would compared greater swap element element shown figure step would compared since less ie swapping would done shown figure step element would compared since less ie swapping would done shown figure pass three elements right positions largest second largest third largest array two elements sorted follow steps pass pass step first compare swap greater array sorted array elements correct positions differences bubble sort selection sort bubble sort selection sort bubble sort two adjacent elements compared adjacent elements correct position swapping would performed selection sort minimum element selected array swap element beginning unsorted sub array time complexities best case worst case respectively time complexity best worst cases efficient sorting technique efficient sorting technique compared bubble sort uses exchanging method uses selection method slower selection sort greater number comparisons required faster bubble sort lesser number comparisons required next topictrie data structure prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest tutorials soapui rpa manual
