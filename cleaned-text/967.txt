independent desired output signal system output signal compared input signal means feedback signal system openloop control system also known nonfeedback control system control system without feedback examples automatic washing machine system operating time set manually after completion set time machine stops whether desired cleanness obtained feedback signal machine sense immersion rod system rod heats water much hot water required cannot sensed rod advantages openloop control system open loop systems simple economical less maintenance required difficult disadvantages open loop control system open loop systems inaccurate systems reliable slow optimization possible closed loop control system closed loop control system system control action dependent desired output system output signal compared reference input signal error signal produced error signal fed controller reduce error obtain desired output examples automatic electric iron servo voltage stabilizer air conditioner advantages closedloop systems systems reliable closedloop systems faster many variables handled simultaneously optimization possible disadvantages closedloop systems closedloop systems expensive
