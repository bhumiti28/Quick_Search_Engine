questions next c programming language tutorial c language tutorial programming approach beginners professionals helps understand c language tutorial easily our c tutorial explains topic programs c language developed dennis ritchie creating system applications directly interact hardware devices drivers kernels etc c programming considered base programming languages known mother language defined following ways mother language system programming language procedureoriented programming language structured programming language midlevel programming language c mother language c language considered mother language modern programming languages compilers jvms kernels etc written c language programming languages follow c syntax example c java c etc provides core concepts like array strings functions file handling etc used many languages like c java c etc c system programming language system programming language used create system software c language system programming language used lowlevel programming example driver kernel generally used create hardware devices os drivers kernels etc example linux kernel written c cant used internet programming like java net php etc c procedural language procedure known function method routine subroutine etc procedural language specifies series steps program solve problem procedural language breaks program functions data structures etc c procedural language c variables function prototypes must declared used c structured programming language structured programming language subset procedural language structure means break program parts blocks may easy understand c language break program parts using functions makes program easier understand modify c midlevel programming language c considered middlelevel language supports feature lowlevel highlevel languages c language program converted assembly code supports pointer arithmetic lowlevel machine independent feature highlevel lowlevel language specific one machine ie machine dependent machine dependent fast run easy understand highlevel language specific one machine ie machine independent easy understand c program tutorial c programs given c compiler quickly change c program code file mainc
