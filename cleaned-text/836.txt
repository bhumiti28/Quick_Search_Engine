also known floppy diskette floppy floppy disk used store electronic data like computer file extremely expensive one first types hardware storage created ibm could readwrite portable device when first invented users unable write data like cdrom inches diameter disk able store kb data later versions became capable storing much kb floppy disks replaced devices like usb network file transfer however disks outdated technology advanced floppy disk becoming smaller came three sizes inches inches inches compared previous models floppy newer version store data used cuttingedge technology another version floppy disk inch capable holding kb data introduced later mb could store revisions inch floppy disk early desktop pcs like apple iie used disk drives inch hd high density floppy disk able store mb introduced compared inch disks versions portable also durable backing personal data distributing commercial software titles inch floppy disk became standard next decade over time floppy disks capable reading write data point contained four basic components magnetic readwrite heads containing electronics includes circuit board comprises lever frame helps open close device placed spindle clamping device spinning rotations every minute readwrite head used reading writing could read sides disk erasing data wider head used offered surety data erased floppy discs began replace cdroms late s later consumers also started use recordable cds keeping backup data first mainstream computer apples original imac introduced include floppy disk drive eventually various pc manufacturers followed suit took several years now many people use recordable cds usb flash drives back data software distributed cds dvds finally floppy disks become good thing past storing data data storage medium many people grew hence floppy disk still important role veteran computer users modern times zip drives cds usb har drives introduced how floppy disks used early time computer floppy disks option backup information install new program onto computer cdrom drives usb floppy disks included computers program could able install one floppy disk program size less mb similarly programs needed multiple floppy disks larger size mb types floppy disk several kinds floppy disk drives came market gone times due use inch drive early s inch first floppy design used readonly format become able read write floppy physicality gave entire series floppy drive name inch drive during s inch floppy disk drive produced widely use pcs early s inch floppy disk drives also included computers could ability store data kilobytes megabytes some floppy disks able write data sides disk also allowed modify data after manufacturers floppy disks began develop doublesided drives inch drive another type floppy disk inch floppy drive encased plastic hold megabytes highdensity disk kilobytes double density disk older times computer multiple disks use install program windows zip drive mid s iomega corporation introduced zip drive mainly zip drives able add existing system available peripheral zip drive limited use costly prevent becoming popular storage medium advantages floppy disks floppy disks storage capacity leads unappropriated storing highresolution photos music videos etc although floppy disks shortcomings also notable advantages follows portability relatively small portable one main advantages floppy disks compared cds inch floppy disks smaller size also case transport require place floppy disk designed plastic casing makes stronger protects disk inside comparing cds dvds chance scratching disk lower always enclosed casing floppy disks also prevent data erased overwritten accident includes builtin write protection portability provides users benefit moving smallsize files like documents one device another compatibility also important advantage terms data storage devices older computers older computers may accept data storage devices often compatible floppy disks example early s computers might include cd dvd drive floppy disks option transfer files computer although many newer pcs floppy drives drives included modern pcs phased when computer manufacturers building custommade pc may provide floppy drives option boot disks boot order sequence fdds commonly set main hard drives computer tries boot operating system called boot sequence floppy drive cd drive disk boot program devices high boot order boot list system access next device floppy disks also offer benefit turned boot disks help loading saving convenient program disk instead booting operating system booting disk allows various tasks like troubleshooting system errors checking memory errors disadvantages floppy disks speed rate data transferring slow floppy disk when data transferring computer floppy disk computer floppy disk considerably take much time transferring data storage space floppy disk drives contain limited space holding information provides low storage capacity compared modern storage mediums file corruption file corruption one main disadvantages floppy disk fdds affected external factors like heat magnetic fields thus stored file could corrupted furthermore comparing storage mediums floppy disks provide security vulnerable viruses reason file damage reliability over time use floppy disks decreased stopped till s therefore many computer manufacturers stopped including floppy disk computers after period becomes unreliable source storage physical damages plastic casing used make floppy disk delicate flexible may get easily break anyone catches without proper care history floppy disk drive floppy disk first disk fd introduced diameter capacity one megabyte enclosed cardboard case unlike hard drive heads touched disk example cassette video player wears media time team alan shugart shipped first readwrite floppy disk drive memorex later shugart associates founded shugart cpm first microcomputer operating system shipped however machines era used cassette tape rather floppy disk drives expensive generally early days cost computer price floppy disk end equivalent per piece starting stopping motor dc motor used models corresponding changes interface floppy disk floppy diskette widely used many early microcomputers first started development introduced pin interface later became standard its first price box ten disks first released kb disk space drives produced ten different manufacturers around drives producing shugart day early s production companys decreased increasing competition reliable track loss several lucrative contracts main reason part ibm chose tandon sole supplier disk drives pc apple switched use cheaper alps drive mechanisms computers later xerox purchased shugart sold brand third party closed operations word processors microcomputers floppy drive main storage device s s machines hard drive store information time usually os booted one floppy some machines used two disk drives offer users benefit leaving os disk place copying data one floppy another quad density trackperinch drives introduced early s came increased storage capacity kb after time new ibm machines ibm introduced highdensity disk format drives became optional equipment modern computers floppy disk singlesided unformatted capacity kb inch floppy disk cartridge introduced sony its formatted capacity kb sonys smc first computer used format furthermore drive irregular rectangular shape allow users insert disk sideways mistake possible older formats compared types older drives drives included multiple benefits need index hole requiring
