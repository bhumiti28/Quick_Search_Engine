prev difference renewable nonrenewable resources we often heard terms like renewable nonrenewable resources geography lectures we often taught earths resources limited verge vanishing planet still depleted resources excessively used humans leading extinction people use resources convenience damages natures resources earth able revive resources resources called nonrenewable resources nonrenewable resources depleting day day due excessive use renewable resources hand resources able revive get diminished finished certain differences renewable nonrenewable resources based certain aspects like sources cost environmental impact etc so let us look fundamental differences sno renewable resources nonrenewable resources renewable resources ones get depleted resources condition revive nonrenewable resources resources able revive get depleted excessive usage time renewable resources include resources sunlight wind solar energy thermal energy etc nonrenewable energy includes fossil fuels like coal petroleum etc various gases renewable resources negligible impact environment emissions emit low carbons upon usage therefore resources threat environment hand nonrenewable resources high carbon emissions upon usage burning due high carbon emissions nonrenewable resources threat environment cost related generate energy renewable resources relatively high instance generate solar energy geothermal energy lot technologies used much costlier generating energy nonrenewable resources nonrenewable resources much costlier renewable resources discussed generate energy renewable resources much costlier infrastructure required renewable resources expensive easily accessible hand nonrenewable resources costeffective infrastructure required easily accessible nonrenewable resources energy generation pretty cheap affordable renewable resources large area required instance wind farms solar farms constructed large area energy easily generated resources nonrenewable resources less area required generating energy nonrenewable resources comparatively cheaper compared renewable resources terms cost area environmental effect etc so key points regarding renewable nonrenewable resources well interesting note many debates recently going making uranium renewable resource concluded uranium cannot considered renewable resources cannot revive many natural resources formed many years ago coal petroleum oil natural gas etc resources present beginning sunlight water wind biomass geothermal etc humans clearly dependent upon resources daytoday needs still misuse exploit resources according convenience leads depletion resources excessive use renewable resources cause depletion resources well excessive use resources result limited availability resources particular moment given situation instance sunlight always available us power generate electricity reduces cloudy rainy weather many countries resolved save energy collecting batteries using required instance solar energy stored help solar panels electricity goes solar energy put use many villages towns india making use solar panels several electricity cuts important save energy generated resources used required well nonrenewable resources grave impact climate instance fossil fuels burnt carbon dioxide released harmful environment crisis facing today excessive emissions carbon dioxide according reports emissions control temperature rise degrees due severe water pollution air pollution heat waves etc renewable resources nonrenewable resources important generating energy must make sure resources overused renewable resources abundant nature nonrenewable resources limited must cautious use resources abundant resource limited resource order make full use resources energy resources must stored used time requirement thus renewable nonrenewable resources cautiously used next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest
