possible event impossible event show answer workspace answer d impossible event explanation event never happened known impossible event example tossing doubleheaded coins getting tails impossible event rolling die getting number impossible outcome etc what value pnot e pe show answer workspace answer c explanation probability happening event pe happening pe pe pnot e so pnot e pe since pe pnot e pnot e what probability getting odd numbers dice thrown show answer workspace answer explanation sample space dice rolled s so n s e event getting odd number so n e probability getting odd number p e total number favorable outcomes total number outcomes ne ns what probability getting sum dice thrown show answer workspace answer b explanation two throws dice n s let e event getting sum three e so n e so p e ne ns what probability getting even number dice thrown show answer workspace answer b explanation sample space dice rolled s so n s e event getting even number so n e probability getting even number p e total number favorable outcomestotal number outcomes ne ns probability getting two tails two coins tossed show answer workspace answer d explanation sample space two coins tossed h h h t t h t t so ns event e getting two tails t t so ne so probability getting two tails p e ne ns what probability getting sum prime number two dice thrown show answer workspace answer b explanation per question n s event sum prime number e so n e ne ns what probability getting atleast one head three unbiased coins tossed show answer workspace answer explanation sample space ttt tth tht htt thh hth hht hhh let e event getting atleast one head e tth tht htt thh hth hht hhh pe ne ns what probability getting dice thrown show answer workspace answer b explanation sample space dice rolled s so n s e event getting so n e p e total number favorable outcomes total number outcomes ne ns what probability losing game winning probability show answer workspace answer c explanation let pe probability winning game pnot e probability winning game pe pnot e so pnot e pe since pe pnot e pnot e two dice thrown together probability getting even number one dice odd number dice show answer workspace answer d explanation per question n s let e event getting even number one die odd number e so n e ne ns box orange white blue balls ball picked randomly probability neither orange blue show answer workspace answer explanation total number balls sample space so ns let e event ball drawn neither orange blue event drawn ball white white balls so ne pe nens card drawn pack cards what probability getting king black suit show answer workspace answer explanation we n s event getting black king so n e pe ne ns dice thrown twice what probability getting two numbers whose product even show answer workspace answer d explanation simultaneous throw two dice sample space s so n s event e so n e pe nens suppose number x chosen numbers what probability x show answer workspace answer d explanation numbers given question squares numbers so square four numbers greater therefore probability x number selected random first natural numbers probability selected number multiple none show answer workspace answer c explanation we first natural numbers four common multiples first natural numbers so pmultiple what probability getting prime number numbers started none show answer workspace answer explanation we given first natural numbers twentyfive prime numbers first natural numbers so probability prime numbers pprime what probability drawing ace pack cards none show answer workspace answer b explanation we n s aces deck card probability drawing ace deck card balls batsman hits boundaries times what probability hit boundaries none show answer workspace answer b explanation total number balls boundaries batsman hit balls without boundaries so probability boundary which following probability cannot exist none show answer workspace answer b explanation probability cannot negative lies card drawn pack cards what probability getting queen card show answer workspace answer d explanation we total number cards total number queen cards probability getting queen card what probability impossible event infinity none show answer workspace answer explanation event never happened known impossible event probability impossible event which following probability event show answer workspace answer c explanation probability event neither exceeds unity negative lies three coins tossed simultaneously probability getting two heads together none show answer workspace answer explanation sample space ttt tth tht htt thh hth hht hhh let e event getting two heads together e thh hht hhh pe ne ns probability winning first prize lottery girl total tickets sold many tickets girl purchased none show answer workspace answer explanation probability winning first prize girl total number tickets sold tickets girl purchased blue socks brown socks white socks drawer two socks picked randomly probability selected socks color show answer workspace answer c explanation total number socks socks probability selecting first blue sock probability selecting second blue sock probability selecting two blue socks similarly probability selecting two brown socks similarly probability selecting two white socks so probability two socks color probability two blue socks probability two brown socks probability two white socks card drawn pack cards what probability face card king queen jack show answer workspace answer d explanation total number cards face cards probability getting face card

simultaneously probability getting atmost two heads none show answer workspace answer explanation sample space ttt tth tht htt thh hth hht hhh let e event getting atmost two heads e ttt tth tht htt thh hth hht ne pe ne ns which following statement true probability probability impossible event probability greater less probability cannot greater none show answer workspace answer b probability greater less explanation probability event neither exceeds unity negative lies p probability event probability complement p p p none show answer workspace answer c p explanation none probability selecting bad egg lot eggs so number bad eggs lot show answer workspace answer explanation total number eggs lot probability selecting bad egg total number bad eggs lot using digits number five digits formed without repetition what probability number divisible show answer workspace answer explanation number formed using digits divisible last two digits number so number formed using remaining three digits ie ways number divisible using given digits formed ways total numbers formed using given digits so required probability set one one outcomes experiment called zvalue arithmetic mean event none show answer workspace answer c event explanation performance experiment called trial set outcomes termed event one event occurs another event cannot happen ie events cannot occur simultaneously called exhaustive events mutually exclusive events equally likely events independent events show answer workspace answer b mutually exclusive events explanation events called mutually exclusive cannot occur
