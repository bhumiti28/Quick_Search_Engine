difference mass volume javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference mass volume we heard mass weight volume height etc physics mathematics lectures all know things help us calculating particular things objects out terms mass volume ones confused we think mass volume mean both differ certain aspects so let us discuss detail mass considered property associated physical body reacts motion laymans terms net force applied object objects resistance results change objects position called mass know inertia primary property objects therefore mass quantitative measure inertia mass change motion proportionate ie greater mass object results slight change much motion occurs strength gravitation object also determine mass object si unit mass kg kilogram we must confused mass weight mass like weight however mass object calculated weight still interesting know particular object weigh differently despite mass instance object weigh less moon earth low gravity mass object happens mass considered property helps us determine strength particular object now mass object calculated many theorists given theories calculating mass object let us look three ways calculate mass passive gravitational mass gravitational force object measured calculative theory theory weight exerted object gravitational field inertial mass inertial mass used measure objects resistance response acceleration applied external force active gravitational mass theory measures gravitational force applied object three theories help us determining mass object now must wondering inertia inertial mass properties inertia inertial mass mass directly related inertia let us understand help newtons three laws motion newtons first law object motion remain motion object rest remain rest unless external force applied law called principle inertia newtons second law according law bodys movement changes force applied case object moves direction force applied newtons third law according third law force applied objects equal magnitude differ direction instance first object exerts pressure second object second object also exerts force upon first object making equal magnitude well case calculating mass apply second law motion now let us look units mass tonne equal kg electronvolt unit energy converted unit mass massenergy equivalence atomic mass pound solar mass method used astronomy calculate mass sun ways calculating mass object however object limited earth ways calculating mass object instance solar mass used measuring mass sun space concept used astronomy scientists now let us discuss key points regarding volume object volume defined quantity d space particularly solid plasma gas liquid si unit volume cubic metre instance volume container calculated volume water hold shapes onedimensional twodimensional threedimensional now let us look units volume standard unit volume cubic metre another way calculating volume object litre l formula cubic metre litres volume liquid also measured millilitres formula millilitre cubic centimetre formula used calculating small amounts fluids case larger amounts fluid volume calculated megalitre formula cubic metres megalitre other ways calculating volume include cubic inch cubic yard cubic foot fluid ounce bushel quart fluid dram units used calculating volume object volume particular object calculated various academic fields like calculus differential geometry thermodynamics etc volume computation one ways used calculating volume object method volume calculated examining algorithms objects exact computation comes thermodynamics volume describes thermodynamic state object volume also considered quantity object dependent upon thermodynamic properties like pressure temperature etc now let us look major differences mass volume mass defined physical quantity used calculate inertia object hand volume defined space occupied object mass physical value properties whereas volume geometric value mass also considered weight object whereas volume area given particular object area volume finite mass fixed property whereas property volume changes substance solid liquid gas major differences mass volume object we often get confused two important understand properties terms differentiate two both mass volume used measure weight object methods applied completely different thus terms carry different meaning properties next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube channel join now
