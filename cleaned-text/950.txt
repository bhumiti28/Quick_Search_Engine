kafka stream processing key concepts stream processing miscellaneous kafka message compression kafka security apache kafka vs rabbitmq apache kafka vs apache storm kafka streams vs spark streaming next apache kafka tutorial apache kafka tutorial provides basic advanced concepts apache kafka tutorial designed beginners professionals apache kafka opensource streamprocessing software platform used handle realtime data storage works broker two parties ie sender receiver handle trillions data events day apache kafka tutorial journey cover concepts architecture core concepts what apache kafka apache kafka software platform based distributed streaming process publishsubscribe messaging system let exchanging data applications servers processors well apache kafka originally developed linkedin later donated apache software foundation currently maintained confluent apache software foundation apache kafka resolved lethargic trouble data communication sender receiver what messaging system messaging system simple exchange messages two persons devices etc publishsubscribe messaging system allows sender sendwrite message receiver read message apache kafka sender known producer publishes messages receiver known consumer consumes message subscribing what streaming process streaming process processing data parallelly connected systems process allows different applications limit parallel execution data one record executes without waiting output previous record therefore distributed streaming platform enables user simplify task streaming process parallel execution therefore streaming platform kafka following key capabilities soon streams records occur processes works similar enterprise messaging system publishes subscribes streams records stores streams records faulttolerant durable way learn understand apache kafka aspirants know following four core apis producer api api allowspermits application publish streams records one topics discussed later section consumer api api allows application subscribe one topics process stream records produced streams api api allows application effectively transform input streams output streams permits application act stream processor consumes input stream one topics produce output stream one output topics connector api api executes reusable producer consumer apis existing data systems applications why apache kafka apache kafka software platform following reasons best describes need apache kafka apache kafka capable handling millions data messages per second apache kafka works mediator source system target system thus source system producer data sent apache kafka decouples data target system consumer consumes data kafka apache kafka extremely high performance ie really low latency value less ms proves wellversed software apache kafka resilient architecture resolved unusual complications data sharing organizations netflix uber walmart etc thousands firms make use apache kafka apache kafka able maintain faulttolerance faulttolerance means sometimes consumer successfully consumes message delivered producer consumer fails process message back due backend database failure due presence bug consumer code situation consumer unable consume message consequently apache kafka resolved problem reprocessing data learning kafka good source income so wish raise income future sector learn prerequisite aspirants basic
