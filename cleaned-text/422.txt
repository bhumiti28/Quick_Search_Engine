network switch microprocessor memory flipflop we describe digital hardware using hdl level designs described hdl independent technology easy designing debugging normally useful schematics particularly large circuits what verilog verilog hardware description language hdl used describe digital system network switch microprocessor memory flipflop verilog developed simplify process make hdl robust flexible today verilog popular hdl used practiced throughout semiconductor industry hdl developed enhance design process allowing engineers describe desired hardwares functionality let automation tools convert behavior actual hardware elements like combinational gates sequential logic verilog like hardware description language permits designers design designs either bottomup topdown methodology bottomup design traditional method electronic design bottomup each design performed gatelevel using standards gates design gives way design new structural hierarchical design methods topdown design allows early testing easy change different technologies structured system design offers many benefits verilog abstraction levels verilog supports design many levels abstraction behavioral level registertransfer level gate level behavioral level behavioral level describes system concurrent algorithms behavioral every algorithm sequential means consists set executed instructions one one functions tasks blocks main elements regard structural realization design registertransfer level designs using registertransfer level specify circuits characteristics using operations transfer data registers modern definition rtl code any code synthesizable called rtl code gate level characteristics system described logical links timing properties within logical level all signals discrete signals definite logical values x z usable operations predefined logic primitives basic gates gate level modeling may right idea logic design gate level code generated using tools synthesis tools netlist used gatelevel simulation backend history verilog verilog hdls history goes back s company called gateway design automation developed logic simulator verilogxl hardware description language cadence design systems acquired gateway rights language simulator cadence put language public domain intention become standard nonproprietary language verilog hdl maintained nonprofit making organization accellera formed merger open verilog international ovi vhdl international ovi task taking language ieee standardization procedure december verilog hdl became ieee std significantly revised version published ieee std revision added minor changes accellera also developed new standard systemverilog extends verilog systemverilog became ieee standard how verilog useful verilog creates level abstraction helps hide away details implementation technology example d flipflop design would require knowledge transistors need arranged achieve positiveedge triggered ff rise fall clkq times required latch value onto flop among much technologyoriented details power dissipation timing ability drive nets flops would also require thorough understanding transistors physical characteristics verilog helps us focus behavior leave rest sorted later prerequisites before learning verilog basic knowledge vlsi design language you know logic diagrams work boolean algebra logic gates combinational sequential circuits operators etc you know static timing analysis concepts setup time hold time critical path limits clock frequency etc asic fpga basics synthesis simulation
