cells short cells smallest known particles responsible performing lifes functions each living organism either singlecell organism multicellular organism consisting various cells functioning simultaneously therefore necessary know different types cells here discussing cell types characteristics before discussing different cell types let us first briefly explore definition main functions cells what cell definition cell refers smallest known basic unit life primarily responsible lifes processes simple words cell biological structural basic functional unit life living beings organisms moreover cells tend replicate reason referred building blocks living beings cells typically build structure body elements convert nutrients carried foods energy all organisms cells either single cell unicellular multiple cells multicellular complex found different sizes shapes number cells usually varies one organism another mycoplasmas far smallest type cells biologist robert hooke first discovered cells functions cells some major functions cells discussed facilitate growth mitosis parent cells subdivided daughter cells mitosis process cells multiply facilitate growth organisms provide support structure basic structure organisms made cells cell membrane cell wall primary components organisms work include support structure instance skin composed using large number cells allow transport substances different nutrients imported cells perform chemical processes occurring within cells additionally waste carried chemical processes eliminated cells using active passive transport systems energy production cells use energy perform various chemical processes energy typically produced cells using photosynthesis plants respiration organisms aids reproduction using processes called mitosis meiosis cells aid reproduction mitosis asexual reproduction process primarily responsible producing daughter cells parent cells besides meiosis mainly plays vital role making daughter cells genetically different parent cells classification cell trillions cells special structure function particular different cells produce different tissues organisms every cell equally important we generally classify cells following two broad categories prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells prokaryotic cells prokaryotic cells known smallest earliest types cells singlecelled microorganisms examples prokaryotic include bacteria archaebacteria despite photosynthetic prokaryotic includes cyanobacteria help perform photosynthesis process prokaryotic cells consist single membrane one layers protection outer forces environments usually plasma membrane made using phospholipids surrounded cell wall made primarily using rigid sugar prokaryotic cell wall enclosed thick capsule made using sugars since single membrane metabolic functions performed prokaryotic occur plasma membrane cytosol most prokaryotic cells also cilia tails ways cells control movement prokaryotic cells either freeliving parasites some major characteristics prokaryotic cells listed prokaryotic dont contain membranebound nucleus membranebound organelles dont chloroplast golgi bodies mitochondria lysosomes one essential constituents eukaryotic chromosomes histone protein found prokaryotic prokaryotic genetic material exists single chromosome cell wall present prokaryotic composed amino acids carbohydrates prokaryotic plasma membrane mainly acts mitochondrial membrane carries respiratory enzymes prokaryotic reproduce asexually due binary fission besides sexual mode reproduction consists conjugation following image displays structural view prokaryotic cells generally bacterial cell diagram displays true nucleus absent flagellum present eventually differentiates prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells components prokaryotic cells following components prokaryotic cells plasma membrane outer covering layer phospholipid molecules outer covering helps separate inner components cell outside environment cell wall defined outermost layer helping cells get certain shapes capsule addition cell wall capsule another outer protective layer covering bacterial cells layer mainly keeps cell protected engulfed additionally also supports retaining moisture attachment cells nutrients surfaces mesosome formed extension plasma membrane inside cell wall present form tubules vesicles lamellae ribosomes responsible protein synthesis synthesis process proteins occurs cytoplasm jellylike material within cell composed using cell organelles salts enzymes all cell organelles also suspended dna nucleoid nucleoid area within cytoplasm genetic material found bacterial flagellum important note prokaryotic cells may components prokaryotic cells lack eukaryotic cells eukaryotic cells referred modern types known cell types cells create complex large organisms mostly based multicellular cells organisms humans animals plants fungi protozoa eukaryotic cells organisms called eukaryota cells maintain multiple environments single cell allowing perform different metabolic reactions eventually helps eukaryotic cells grow larger prokaryotic cells however eukaryotic cells mainly characterized presence true nucleus nucleus refers membraneenclosed organelle consisting dna organized single multiple linear molecules linear molecules known chromosomes since eukaryotic cells contain one chromosome typically large amounts genetic information within multicellular organisms body various genes within chromosomes ultimately allows cells different traits function differently within organism some major characteristics eukaryotic cells listed eukaryotic cells consist nucleus enclosed nuclear membrane eukaryotic cells cell wall outermost layer cells reproduce process termed mitosis eukaryotic cells include mitochondria almost eukaryotic cells structured cytoskeletal flagella cilia act locomotory organs eukaryotic cells nucleus present eukaryotic cells includes single linear dna carrying genetic information following image displays structural view eukaryotic cells diagram displays presence nucleus along membranebound organelles components eukaryotic cells following components eukaryotic cells nucleus involves single linear dna carrying related genetic information production ribosomes also occurs endoplasmic reticulum acts network consisting small tabularshaped structures typically help divide cell surfaces luminal extraluminal cytoplasm contains cytoskeleton also includes microtubules microfilaments fiber generate cells shape stimulate cellmovements manage cellorganelles cell membrane mainly helps separating cells outer environment also contains specific embedded proteins take part exchange substances cells inandout dna dna organized long structures known chromosomes lysosome mainly helps processing hydrolytic enzymes digest lipids proteins carbohydrates nucleic acids body ribosome main region protein synthesis occurs ribosomes usually made proteins ribonucleic acids mitochondria plays vital role production energy helps cellmetabolism regulation golgi apparatus composed using flat discshaped structure known cisternae mainly plays vital role glycolipids glycoproteins formation important note eukaryotic cells may components eukaryotic cells lack types cells human body trillion cells human body additionally many cells one million die every second human body replaced new cells however nothing worry fundamental function living organisms human highly evolved multicellular organism created eukaryotic cells besides plants animals fungi also created eukaryotic cells following common cells found human body stem cells before cell specialized originates unspecified known stem cell stem cells pluripotent meaning take form cell human body cells typically ancestors specialized cell body even basic cell complex neurons process conversion stem cells cells known cell differentiation cell differentiation process usually managed inner genetics several outer factors including chemical physical contact cells furthermore stem cells replicate long timeperiods bone cells bone cells also called bones mineralized connective tissue usually takes part skeletal system bones typically combination collagen matrix calcium phosphate minerals three main types cells human body osteoclasts osteoblasts osteocytes osteoclasts large help regenerate assimilate bones healing osteoblasts help regulate bone mineralization generate osteoid osteoid organic material bone matrix usually mineralizes produce bone furthermore osteoblasts mature produce osteocytes osteocytes incorporate process bone formation take part maintaining calcium balance other typical bone cells lining cells first originate osteoblasts becoming lining cells lining cells flat structure lining bone surface responsible release calcium blood cells blood cells essential human body either transporting oxygen within body fighting infections bone marrow typically generates cells mainly three blood cells red blood cells white blood cells platelets red blood cells help determining blood type take part oxygen transportation white blood cells usually termed immune system cells responsible destroying pathogens providing immunity platelets support clot blood prevent excessive blood loss blood vessels damaged broken muscle cells muscle cells also called myocytes produce muscle tissue helps various functions body movement support various internal functions cells long tabular mainly three types muscle cells skeletal cardiac smooth skeletal muscle cells help connect bones perform voluntary movements connective tissues cover skeletal muscle cells protect support muscle fiber bundles cardiac muscle cells help produce involuntary muscle types muscle found within heart usually need conscious efforts operating smooth muscle cells help produce involuntary muscle neither striated like skeletal muscle heart muscle involuntary muscles mainly help inline cavities human body furthermore also create walls various organs including kidneys blood vessels intestines airways lungs fat cells fat cells commonly known adipocytes one primary components adipose tissue cells consist droplets triglycerides stored fat help fulfill energy needs when fat within cells cells seem round swollen after fat consumed cells shrink accordingly fat cells also take part hormone
