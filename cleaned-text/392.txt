binomial heap already discussed heap data structure two types ie min heap max heap binomial heap defined collection binomial tree satisfies heap properties ie min heap min heap heap node value lesser value child nodes understand binomial heap first understand binomial tree what binomial tree binomial tree tree bk ordered tree defined recursively k defined order binomial tree binomial tree represented b tree consists single node general terms bk consists two binomial trees ie bk bk linked together one tree becomes left subtree another binomial tree represented lets understand examples b k means would exist one node tree shown b k means k equal therefore would two binomial trees b one b becomes left subtree another b b k means k equal therefore would two binomial trees b one b becomes left subtree another b b k means k equal therefore would two binomial trees b one b becomes left subtree another b properties binomial tree k k number nodes k number nodes height tree k k height tree would k height tree would exactly kci ki nodes depth k example k equal depth i determine number nodes binomial heap binomial heap collection binomial trees satisfies properties min heap following two properties binomial heap each binomial heap obeys minheap properties nonnegative integer k atleast one binomial tree heap root degree k lets understand two properties example figure three binomial trees ie b b b three binomial trees satisfy min heaps property nodes smaller value child nodes figure also satisfies second property binomial heap example consider value k observe figure binomial tree degree exists heap representation binomial heap node figure shows representation binomial heap node memory first block memory contains pointer stores address parent node second block stores key value node third block contains degree node fourth block divided two parts ie left child sibling left child contains address left child node whereas sibling contains address sibling important point want create binomial heap n nodes simply defined binary number n example want create binomial heap nodes binary form start numbering rightmost digit observe available positions therefore binomial heap nodes b b b binomial trees lets consider another example want create binomial heap nodes binary form observe binary number digit available position therefore binomial heap contain binomial trees degree operations binomial heap creating new binomial heap when create new binomial heap simply takes o time creating heap create head heap elements attached finding minimum key know binomial heap collection binomial trees binomial tree satisfies property min heap means root node contains minimum value therefore need compare root node binomial trees find minimum key time complexity finding minimum key ologn union two binomial heap want combine two binomial heaps simply find union two binomial heaps time complexity finding union ologn inserting node time complexity inserting node ologn extracting minimum key time complexity removing minimum key ologn decreasing key when key value node changed binomial tree satisfy minheap we need perform rearrangements order satisfy minheap property time complexity would ologn deleting node time complexity deleting node ologn union two binomial heap perform union two binomial heap use following cases case degreex equal degreenext x move pointer ahead case degreex degreenext x degreesiblingnext x move pointer ahead case degreex degreenext x equal degreesiblingnext x keyx keynext x remove next x root attached x case degreex degreenext x equal degreesiblingnext x keyx keynext x remove x root attached next x lets understand union two binomial heaps example observe figure two binomial heaps first combine two binomial heaps combine two binomial heaps need arrange increasing order binomial trees shown initially x points b value nextx points b value b sibling b node value therefore sibling b represented siblingnext x now apply case case says degreex equal degreenext x move pointer ahead example degree x degree next x case valid now apply case case says degreex degreenext x degreesiblingnext x move pointer ahead example degree x degree next x equal degree sibling next x therefore case valid now apply case case says degreex degreenext x equal degreesiblingnext x keyx keynext x remove next x root attached x example degree x equal degree next x equal degree sibling next x key value x ie less value next x ie therefore case valid so remove next x ie root attach x ie shown observe binomial heap node attached node now reapply cases binomial heap first apply case since x pointing node next x pointing node degree x equal degree next x therefore case valid now apply case since degree x equal degree next x also equal degree sibling next x therefore case valid we move pointer ahead shown observe figure x points binomial tree root node nextx points binomial tree root node prevx points binomial tree root node siblingnextx points binomial tree root node now apply case tree since degree x equal degree next x ie equal degree sibling next x ie either case case valid based second condition key value x ie greater key value nextx ie therefore say case valid here need remove x attach nextx shown observe figure x becomes left child nextx pointer also gets updated now x point binomial tree root node degree also changed nextx points binomial tree root node siblingnextx point binomial tree root node tree degree x ie b degree nextx ie b equal degree siblingnextx ie b therefore either case case valid based second condition since key value x less value nextx need remove nextx attach x shown observe figure nextx becomes left child x degree x also gets changed b pointer nextx also gets updated points binomial tree root node degree x degree nextx since degrees x nextx equal case valid we move pointer ahead x points node b last binomial tree heap leads termination loop tree final tree union two binomial heaps inserting new node binomial heap now see insert new node heap consider heap want insert node heap heap three binomial trees degree b b b b attached head heap lets assume node attached head heap shown first combine two heaps degree node node b node attached node shown figure now assign x b key value nextx b key value siblingnextx b key value since degree x equal degree nextx equal degree sibling nextx either case case applied heap key value x greater key value nextx therefore nextx would removed attached x now reapply cases heap now x points node degree b nextx points node degree b siblingnextx points node degree b since degree x degree nextx equal degree sibling nextx either case case applied key value x greater key value nextx therefore x removed attached x shown observe figure x attached nextx degree node changed b pointers also get updated now x points node nextx points node now reapply cases heap since degree x equal degree nextx key value x less key value nextx therefore nextx would removed heap attached x shown observe heap degree x gets changed final binomial heap inserting node extracting minimum key here extracting minimum key means need remove element minimum key value we already know min heap root element contains minimum key value therefore compare key value root node binomial trees consider binomial heap given heap key values root node binomial trees key value minimum value remove node tree shown observe binomial heap degree node b degree node b degree node b pointer x points node nextx points node siblingnextx points node since degree x equal degree nextx equal degree siblingnextx therefore either case case applied heap key value x less key value nextx node removed attached node shown degree node also changed decreasing key now see decrease key help example consider heap decrease key after decreasing key heap would look like since heap satisfy minheap property element compared element since element less element swapped element shown now compare element root element ie since element less element element swapped element shown now heap satisfies property minheap deleting node now see delete node help example consider heap want delete node first replace node smallest value smallest value infinity shown now swap infinity root node tree shown next step extract minimum key since minimum key heap infinity extract key heap would
