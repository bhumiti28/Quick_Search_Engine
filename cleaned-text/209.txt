learning ios applications use coreml incorporate machine learning ios applications apples framework use pretrained models ios applications tutorial discuss machine learning different types including reallife examples machine learning machine learning field study allows computers learn without explicitly programmed using machine learning dont need provide explicit instructions computers reacting special situations we need provide training computers find realtime solutions specific problems chess game famous example machine learning used play chess code lets machine learn optimizes repeated games machine learning broadly classified two main categories supervised machine learning unsupervised machine learning supervised learning supervised learning similar trainer teacher supervises machines reactions tells stepbystep solutions specific problems its like handholding way teaching computers one realtime example supervised learning recognizing different types images using computers being humans also learn model taught recognize different objects like car repeat exposures way machines taught we feed different set specific images machine image specific identifier identify type image however computers taught every time particular blend pixels comes front computer recognize type image loaded model dataset supervised learning works way computer learn previous exposures example computer sees car object recognizes like car next time able identify different image car object identifying lot features similar previously identified images car when train machine learning model image recognition present many images every single image attached label data clearly labeled gets stored machine learning model once complete training present objects image part training data machine able identify classifying previous learnings fundamental type supervised learning called classification out machine learning model must able classify different bunch images must programmed different objects recognized according unique characteristics however create generic classifier dependent learning data we dont need recode entire model changing training data unsupervised learning supervised learning specific kind dataset loaded computers learn repeat exposures dataset section article discuss unsupervised learning one major types machine learning instead providing training data every piece data clearly labeled provide unstructured training data unsupervised learning we want model sense dataset learns find structure unstructured data words say unsupervised learning dont tell computers kind data instead want computers see structure data observing way data organized one type unsupervised learning called clustering computer looks dataset features figure separate clusters data maintained reinforcement learning we covered supervised learning loaded labeled training data machine learning models computers classify data performs regressions identify dataset we also covered unsupervised learning we loaded unstructured unlabeled dataset grouped separate clusters want computers smart enough identify separate clusters section article discuss reinforcement learning humans much experienced reinforcement learning we tend learn reinforcement example driving route full traffic jam well ignore going route days two kinds reinforcements generally come positive negative reinforcement way machine works case reinforcement algorithms one realtime examples reinforcement learning chess game computer reinforcement learning algorithm calculates winning probability every move computer might come positive well negative reinforcement every single move however many cycles training practicing games computers learn moves situations lead increase winning percentage next
