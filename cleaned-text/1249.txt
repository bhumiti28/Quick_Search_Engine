multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types joints humans vertebrates framework bones formed called skeletal system about bones adult human body give structural shape provide protection inner organs help locomotion body movements bones different parts body connected way easily move accordingly facilitate proper movements different joints exist human body article discussing major types joints present human body before discussing various joints types let us first discuss definition joint major components what joint particular joint refers point two objects connect context human body skeleton system joint refers point two bones intersect words joint characterized connection occurs bones skeletal system joint also referred articulation articular surface definition joint refers point two bones connect establish framework permits movements joints essential organs almost body movements involve bones because joints move body parts example bending knees elbows rotating shoulders swiveling neck etc particular muscles force utilized carry movements different types joints however degree ease movement various joints depend lots factors some common areas joints occur human body displayed following image bones typically connected joints using tissue components make functional components joints joints typically consist following major parts cartilage cartilage defined tissue covering bones surface joints mainly helps reducing friction movement within joints synovial membrane synovial membrane type tissue typically helps line joints seal joint capsule furthermore secretes clear sticky fluid synovial fluid around joints lubricate ligaments ligaments defined rigid elastic bands connective tissue surrounding joints add additional support limit joints movements particular ligaments help connect bones tendons tendons another strong connective tissue mainly helps connect muscles bones present side joints attaching muscles control joints movements bursas bursas typical fluidfilled sacs commonly found bones ligaments nearby structures primary function bursas help reduce friction joints synovial fluid synovial fluid clear viscous fluid secreted synovial membrane meniscus meniscus distinctly curved part cartilage found knees joints types joints different types joints mainly define degrees types movement corresponding part body used easily classified based following two types functional classification joints structural classification joints let us discuss detail classification joints based functionality joints functional classification primarily based type movements type degree permission depending type degree movement allowed joints divided three types immovable slightly movable freely movable joints each type mentioned examples immovable joints immovable joints refer joints allow movement joints also called synarthrosis sutures found skull gomphosis connect teeth skull common examples immovable joints slightly movable joints slightly movable joints typically allow little movement joints joints also called amphiarthrosis intervertebral disks found spine public symphysis found hips common examples slightly movable joints freely movable joints another type joint freely movable joints also called diarthrosis joints joints allow highest range movements types joints flexible allow bodyparts move different directions freely examples freely movable joints include wrist shoulder knee elbow etc classification joints based structure based joints structural classification mainly three types fibrous cartilaginous synovial joints let us discuss detail fibrous joints fibrous joints simplest type joints little mobility means joints present body areas bones flexibility require motion fibrous joints adjacent bones connected using fibrous connective tissue since space left bones fibrous joints permit movement another way movements minor almost negligible immovable fixed joints interlocked irregular edges distinct style particular fibrous joints formed mainly create structure human bodys specific part joints usually found three distinct parts body depending types fibrous joints subdivided following three types sutures sutures found skull three years age soft areas regions typically fuse cranial bones often called cranial sutures simple words sutures joints usually help holding skull bones tightly using short connective tissue fibers called sutural ligaments besides adjacent bones ossify time therefore suture lines usually obliterated syndesmoses second type fibrous joints termed syndesmoses syndesmoses represent joints bones interconnected using band connective tissue called interosseous ligaments eventually allows little movement connective tissue fibers amount movement mainly depends length individual fibers gomphosis third final fibrous joints gomphosis found mouth gomphoses plural gomphosis refer points teeth pegged end joined dental alveoli simple words gomphosis found teeth sockets tooth bound sockets using connective tissue named periodontal ligament cartilaginous joints cartilaginous joints identified joints bones connected using cartilage joints typically allow movements fibrous joints less synovial joints words joints partially movable cartilaginous joints permit range movements lying movements allowed fibrous synovial joints cartilaginous joints subdivided following two types synchondrosis joints synchondrosis joints often termed primary cartilaginous joints joints hyaline cartilage usually meets bones syynchondrosis joints found epiphyseal growth plates growing bones young children epiphyseal plates found end long bones mainly help grow bones children besides cartilaginous joints temporary typically last end childrens puberty symphysis joints symphysis joints symphyses often called secondary cartilaginous joints joints mainly found along midline body permanent generally symphysis joints involve adjacent bone surfaces lined hyaline cartilage connected fibrous tissue joints degree mobility allowing little movement sometimes also joint cavities never synovial common examples symphysis joints include intervertebral joints pubic symphysis manubriosternal angle louis synovial joints synovial joints common types joints human body joints helping us perform movements types joints typically space adjacent bones space known synovial cavity consists synovial fluid synovial fluid mainly takes part lubricating joints reduce friction bones result synovial joints provide range movements walking dancing typing many apart ends bones covered protected layer articular cartilage articular capsule protects whole joint articular capsule consists connective tissue permits movements proper directions blocking wrong direction movements furthermore also provides ligaments hold bones tightly major examples synovial joints shoulders elbows knees synovial joints subdivided following six types ball socket joints types joints rounded head one bone hooked cup another bone ball socket joints typically allow movements almost directions including forward backward sideways rotary movements common examples ball socket joints shoulder joints hip joints hinge joints hinge joints similar door allowing us open close one direction single plane more specifically hinge joints allow movements forward backward directions bending straightening movements across one plane common examples hinge joints fingers elbows knee ankle toes etc condyloid joints condyloid joints refer joints contain two axes move support rotation types joints mainly allow sidebyside movements updown movements condyloid joints also called condylar ellipsoid joints joints found fingers base primarily index finger wrist carpals wrist joints elbows pivot joints pivot joints known providing limited rotary movements full rotation impossible joints one bone typically tapped bone first one swivel ring area formed second bone joints usually permit sideways backforth movements pivot joints also called pivotal joints rotary joints trochoid joints pivot joint found top neck atlas axis bones first second vertebrae neck another example includes joints found ulna radius bones mainly help rotating forearm gliding joints gliding joints joints allow two flat round bones move freely simultaneously bones rub crush one another gliding joints also called plane joints planar joints gliding joints common type synovial joints joints found parts body two different bones meet slip one another direction major examples gliding joints include ankle joints lower legs intercarpal joints hands saddle joints saddle joints permit rotation formed way allow movements two planes saddle joints biaxial typically allow flexion extension adduction abduction circumduction thumb bone contains saddle joints first metacarpal trapezium we move thumb backforth sideways directions due saddle joints crossing palm ranges motion joints based axes mainly four different types ranges motion joints based location joints uniaxial biaxial polyaxial gliding uniaxial joints allow movements single axis come category uniaxial typically enable moving bones back forth along axis biaxial joints permitting movement two distinct axes come category biaxial polyaxial joints usually allow movements along three axes come category polyaxial gliding movements gliding movement refers types joints allow bones slide one another mainly includes flat bones next topictypes volcanoes prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest
