multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types plants wide variety plants worldwide despite different types plants similar functions generally usually recognize plants provide flowers food others grow taking part photosynthesis doesnt matter flowering plant nonflowering plant kinds plants necessary living essential part aquatic systems grow types atmospheric conditions article discussing different types plants article also outlines definition examples type before discuss various plant types let us discuss term plant what plant plants defined multicellular organisms meaning living things however cannot move like humans living species grow almost anywhere earth snowy mountain slopes dry hot deserts plants create foods taking energy sunlight primary source energy earth provide energy ecosystem making essential ecosystem plants use process called photosynthesis consume energy sunlight grow reproduce also receive nutrients soil all organisms food chain receive energy plants directly consuming consuming organisms depend plants animals eat kinds plants plants also produce fruits vegetables grains help form basic human foods besides also produce substantial proportion worlds molecular oxygen therefore plants basis earths ecosystems types plants plants classified based various factors roots heights fruits flowers leaves branches genera species families etc however mainly divided based following two major factors classification plants based growth habits classification plants based seeds two classifications allow us identify plant types easily let us discuss type detail classification plants based growth habits simplest classification plants possible based growth habits meaning plants growth development happen usually involves plants shapes heights specific process growth undergo multiple factors take part plants growth habit therefore different heights thicknesses structures etc based growth habits plants mainly divided following types herbs herbs types plants small size soft green delicate stems wood tissue may may branches herb known complete life cycle one two seasons plants generally strong roots therefore easily uprooted besides herbs substantial nutritional benefits making part healthy balanced diet bananas tomatoes paddy wheat examples herbs contain significant amounts vitamins minerals shrubs shrubs relatively large compared herbs mediumsized plants many branches height shrubs vary m m other features include woody stems bushy hardy however stems tough flexible life span shrubs depends solely species concerned most shrubs benefit occasional trim trimming helps develop new fresh branches however recommended always wait trimming shrub finished flowering season rose basil jasmine henna commonly found shrubs trees trees plant types tall cover fairly large area once fully grown much larger herbs shrubs even tree largest type plant trees include hard woody thick stems known trunks trunk usually produces many branches help leaves fruits flowers grow always case some trees include branches usually leaves flowers fruits main stem trunk coconut tree one plant trees life span comparatively long means grow many years mango neem banyan oak teak cashew examples commonly found trees creepers name suggests creepers plants known creep characteristics means usually grow crawling surface ground include thin long delicate stems stems creepers even help stand therefore plants continue grow ground most creepers plant fruit surface pumpkin watermelon strawberry sweet potato examples creepers climbers climbers almost similar creepers however one major advantage although climbers thin weak stems compared creepers additional support additional support mainly helps grow vertically surrounding elements walls trees etc allows carry particular weight including fruits climbers usually unique part called tendrils help climb some popular climbers money plants green peas sweet gourd grapes runner beans pea plant etc classification plants based seeds based seeds plants mainly classified two groups seedbearing plants plants seeds plants without seeds plants seeds category plants includes types flowering plants ginkgo conifers cedars firs junipers pines spruce etc cycads palmlike plants consisting cones all plants seeds either encased inside cones fruits flowering plants typically produce seeds inside fruits includes soft fruits apples berries oranges etc hard fruits kinds nuts all species plants contain seeds known vascular plants besides seedbearing plants flowers termed angiosperms gymnosperms coneproducing trees seedbearing plants one largest groups landplants world plant species earth contain seeds lets take look four major groups plants reproduce seeds flowering plants flowering plants beautiful types plants flowering plants include small rose plant tall oak tree kinds plants characterized angiosperms produce seeds flowers take part reproductive system means seeds flowering plants act plants reproductive organs since flowering plants complex system usually helps transport fluids parts plants also called vascular plants furthermore plants also subdivided annuals perennials based surviving capability winter season some flowers bloom spring others start flowering spring continue bloom fall following common types flowering plants flowering annual plants annual plants type plants usually die winter season release dormant seed some popular annual plants produce flowers petunias poppies snapdragons pansies winter violas marigolds etc flowering perennial plants perennial plants known produce flowers every year specific period need replant types plants often actual life span perennials mainly varies plant plant some flowering plants also termed tender perennials typically grow annuals cold atmosphere some popular perennial plants produce flowers years years roses dahlias succulents hibiscus lilac shrubs tulips daffodils etc exoticlooking orchids plants beautiful plants grow indoors available several varieties one different colors common easy care example exoticlooking orchid include phalaenopsis orchids large colorful petals random markings ivy flowering vines ivy land plant grow well indoors outdoors ivy consists seeds characterized angiosperm particular ivy also called hedera fastgrowing plant trailing features means climb walls trellises green leafy plant mostly used hanging baskets plant member flowering plants typically produces blossoms year different species ivy ornamental grasses wide range ornamental grasses different heights colors mainly used preservation around garden beautification main advantage plants versatile easily grow little maintenance also seedbearing characteristic helps reproduce height ornamental grasses vary centimeters meters ginkgo ginkgo type tree plant produces seeds plant classified division ginkgophyta all related species ginkgo gone extinct long ago therefore ginkgo considered unique type plant completely different plant species unique leaves fanshaped structure shape inches cm furthermore produces fruits contain seeds similar fruits called false fruits ginkgo biloba tree native china many uses traditional medicine conifers conifers mostly woody shrublife plants trees categorized division pinophyta usually grow climates worldwide however commonly found northern hemisphere conifers plants long large majestic trees small grow inside home ornamental gardens most large conifers consist drooping leaves covered within soft pine needles small conifers species shrublike evergreen plants generally conifers distinguished seedproducing cones additionally also identified unique bluishgray green silvery foliage best known surviving capability cold regions some species conifers survive f c lower temperatures some popular conifers pines cedars junipers spruce etc cycads cycads defined exotic plants mainly grow tropical subtropical regions world plants commonly woody trunks produce large evergreen leaves since leaves directly form trunks cycads branches plants seeds seeds produced inside coneline structures tend reproduce using beetles help pollinate seeds cycads known grow warm climates significant amounts varieties cycads found different sizes smallest type cycads tiny trunk usually centimeters type trunks cycads small leaves seem grown directly ground eventually makes difficult distinguish plant species ferns besides cycads grow long reach feet plants without seeds category plants includes kinds algae liverworts mosses ferns seeds instead produce spores typically distributed wind spores help grow reproduce new tiny plants called gametophytes lets take look four major groups plants reproduce without seeds algae algae plants commonly grow water bodies diverse range seedless plants parts algae however typically categorized brown algae green algae red algae since algae consist diverse species plants categorized groups relate one another algae small microscopic organisms could consumed food various marine animals besides seaweed usually developed water bodies around coastlines algae found worldwide although algae characterized plants confusion regarding some species algae believed ability eat organisms similar animals however algae use photosynthesis make food mostly grouped plant types brown algae brown algae common type seedless plant some species brown algae believed largest plants worldwide typically tall feet m height however brown algae plants grow sea good eating example type edible brown algae sea kelp contains significant amount iodine green algae green algae seedless plants commonly grow freshwater however also found saltwater generally species green algae tiny microscopic organisms when grow majority almost turn ponds seawaters surface green like brown algae many species green algae grow seaweed red algae red algae also called rhodophyta contain species algae amongst three groups phyla typically grow marine environmental conditions red algae produce seeds good source food many organisms kind algae used nori liverworts liverworts known nonvascular plants flowers contain seeds small leafy plants generally size mm mm wide plants known flourish damp areas liverworts include many species plants small species sometimes become hard differentiate mosses one effective way differentiate liverworts typically tiny hairlike structures called rhizoids mainly helps absorb significant amount water besides believed liverworts developed algae since plants lower structure considered advanced algae plants liverworts categorized division marchantiophyta mosses like liverworts mosses also called moss short plants also grow mainly damp places unique types plants necessarily require soil means also grow without presence soil mosses often grow rocks trees even concrete around species moss species categorized division bryophyta ferns ferns another group plants contain seeds also flowerless categorized division polypodiopsida unlike algae mosses ferns vascular plants distribute spores eventually helps reproduce species ferns few believed oldest types plants earth ferns typically distinguished green leafy foliage also contains pinnae fronds most ferns generally grow damp shady places besides grow feet m tall suitable conditions next topicbridge rectifier prev next videos join
