difference dna rna javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference dna rna we might studied lot things regarding human system science classes we studied lot respiratory system nervous system white blood cells red blood cells etc one important topic studied science lectures ie dna rna what dna rna helps body fight several diseases well interesting note dna rna nucleic acids so let us discuss detail dna stands deoxyribonucleic acid dna consists molecular chain molecular chain gives general instructions body development growth functioning viruses organisms occur dna one major types macromolecule now macromolecule defined large molecule consisting covalent atoms bound together macromolecules important forms life present earth dna double helix consisting two strands two strands known polynucleotides polynucleotide considered biopolymer comprises atomic bonds polynucleotide chainlike structure nucleotide comprises four nucleobases made nitrogen nucleobases cytosine guanine adenine thymine deoxyribose phosphate out six elements dna use four elements make nucleobase nitrogenbased elements combined hydrogen bonds dna made dna divided two groups namely pyrimidines purines pyridimines consist two elements ie thymine cytosine hand purines consist two elements ie adenine guanine four elements considered complementary bonds remaining two elements ie phosphate deoxyribose primary bonds used nucleobases interesting note two strands dna run parallel dna transforms long structures eukaryotic cells long structures known chromosomes before cell division takes place chromosomes replicated animals plants fungi eukaryotic organisms organisms store dna cell nucleus mitochondria former known nuclear dna latter called mitochondrial dna chloroplast dna contrary bacteria archaea store dna cytoplasm now let us look chemical modifications dna dna packed chromosomes capable influencing genes structure called chromatin high levels methyl cytosine gene modification vertebrates higher methyl cytosine levels caenorhabditis elegans wormlike structure lack elements how dna damaged well possible damage dna mutagens mutagen considered physical agent capable changing genetic material mutagen capable changing dna sequence mutagens comprises oxidizing agents electromagnetic forces alkylating agents uv rays etc forces mentioned damage dna here interesting fact know ie human cell comprises bases undergo damage dangerous form damage happens dna wherein cells cannot repair chromosomal translocations occur system mutations system cause cancer damage dna normally occurs also cause cancer people live long enough naturally damaged dna automatically develop cancer cure dna damage well certain medications prescribed doctors help lowering levels damage now let us discuss rna rna stands ribonucleic acid rna polymeric molecule plays lot roles rna molecules responsible coding decoding regulating genes just like dna rna also nucleic acid rna also chainlike structure comprises one strand unlike dna cellular organisms convey genetic information messenger rna commonly known mrna rna plays various roles human body like controlling gene expression mobilize biological reactions responding cellular signals rna uses universal process synthesis proteins takes place process known protein synthesis well four kinds rna let us look trna trna responsible carrying amino acids ribosomes mrna messenger rna responsible encoding amino acid sequences rrna kind rna responsible producing ribosomes ribosomes combined ribosomal proteins perform function mrna snrna smaller nuclear rna responsible forming proteins complexes combination used rna producing eukaryotes so four kinds rna perform several functions human body now let us look important differences dna rna rna singlestranded whereas dna doublestranded dna located mitochondria nucleus cell hand rna located ribosome cytoplasm nucleus dna consists deoxyribose sugar element comparison dna rna consists ribose also kind sugar consists vitamins enzymes dna responsible transmitting genetic information hand rna responsible transmitting genetic code genetic code helps creating necessary amount protein dna duplicate process selfreplication whereas rna cannot replicate synthesized help dna base pairing dna guanine cytosine adenine thymine base pairing rna guanine cytosine adenine uracil major differences dna rna both dna rna important cellular organisms perform various functions also help preventing body various viruses both responsible mobilizing body thus dna rna responsible regulating body fighting several diseases next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube channel
