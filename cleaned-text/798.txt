tutorial explains basics dbms architecture data models data schemas data independence er model relation model relational database design storage file structure much why learn dbms traditionally data organized file formats dbms new concept research done make overcome deficiencies traditional style data management modern dbms following characteristics realworld entity modern dbms realistic uses realworld entities design architecture uses behavior attributes example school database may use students entity age attribute relationbased tables dbms allows entities relations among form tables user understand architecture database looking table names isolation data application database system entirely different data database active entity whereas data said passive database works organizes dbms also stores metadata data data ease process less redundancy dbms follows rules normalization splits relation attributes redundancy values normalization mathematically rich scientific process reduces data redundancy consistency consistency state every relation database remains consistent exist methods techniques detect attempt leaving database inconsistent state dbms provide greater consistency compared earlier forms data storing applications like fileprocessing systems query language dbms equipped query language makes efficient retrieve manipulate data user apply many different filtering options required retrieve set data traditionally possible fileprocessing system used applications dbms database collection related data data collection facts figures processed produce information mostly data represents recordable facts data aids producing information based facts example data marks obtained students conclude toppers average marks database management system stores data way becomes easier retrieve manipulate produce information following important characteristics applications dbms acid properties dbms follows concepts atomicity consistency isolation durability normally shortened acid concepts applied transactions manipulate data database acid properties help database stay healthy multitransactional environments case failure multiuser concurrent access dbms supports multiuser environment allows access manipulate data parallel though restrictions transactions users attempt handle data item users always unaware multiple views dbms offers multiple views different users user sales department different view database person working production department feature enables users concentrate view database according requirements security features like multiple views offer security extent users unable access data users departments dbms offers methods impose constraints entering data database retrieving later stage dbms offers many different levels security features enables multiple users different views different features example user sales department cannot see data belongs purchase department additionally also managed much data sales department displayed user since dbms saved disk traditional file systems hard miscreants break code audience dbms tutorial especially help computer science graduates understanding basictoadvanced concepts related database management systems prerequisites before start proceeding tutorial recommended good understanding basic computer concepts primary memory secondary memory data structures algorithms
