tutorial provides basic advances concepts kivy our kivy tutorial designed beginners well working professionals kivy multiplatform application development framework python allows us develop multiplatform applications various platforms windows linux android macos ios raspberry pi kivy tutorial discuss following topics what kivy features kivy advantages disadvantages kivy kivy architecture kivy installation windows create hello world program kivy add image kivy kivy buttons kivy widgets kivy layouts create popup window kivy crete sign window kivy what kivy kivy opensource graphical user interface gui development platform python helps us develop mobile applications multitouch application software nui natural user interface allows developers build application use across devices also access mobile apis manipulate things camera phone gps tracking vibrator contains various components creating application graphical library opengl es extensive range widgets support multitouch intermediate kv language design custom widgets extensive support input devices mouse keyboard tuio well osspecific multi touches events features kivy following cool features kivy video kivy includes various modules play video files streams kivy video player also supports common requirements related videos play pause stop buttons text used subtitle display messages user videos example pygame video provider supports mpeg linux multitouch gestures kivy uses wide range widgets support multitouch gestures kivy developers provide gesture library record users gesture following three gestures record left right horizontal line right left horizontal line bottom top vertical line ui features kivy comes number widgets controls make mobile interface attractive beautiful also used improve onehanded usability navigate gestures create new icons design elements dark mode new animations visual effects opengl kivy uses pygame easily creating new games pygame comes various modules drawing shapes dealing colors playing music flexible kivy flexible run variety devices including linux mobile phones windows tablets ios raspberry pi kivy flexible adapt new technologies quickly free kivy framework completely free use work kivy must ghz bit x bit x cpu gb ram mb graphical memory python installed system advantages disadvantages kivy advantages list advantages kivy given kivy helps us design innovative user interfaces multitouch functionalities smoothly work various platforms windows android linux ios macos raspberry pi helps us run code supported platforms provides welldocumented apis offers better representation programs including classes widget configuration inherited classes performs better html disadvantages kivy uses kv language suitable us compile code alone always uptodate latest android apis takes lot time building compiling mobile applications sizes package unnecessarily huge lack community support kivy architecture screenshot shows kivy architecture kivy architecture contains following components core providers input providers kivy providers mainly abstract various core tasks includes opening window displaying images text playing audio spelling correction fetching images camera input provider piece code helps us add support specific input device tuio mouse emulator apples trackpads we also add support new input devices providing new class reads input data device transform kivy events graphics kivy graphics apis ability automatically optimize drawing commands core core provides following features clock clock used schedule timer events clock supported oneshot timers periodic timers cache kivy cache used store python objects we control cache following two ways object limit timeout note we also create new cache kivy limit objects timeout seconds gesture detection kivy uses simple gesture detection used detect various types strokes circles rectangles squares kivy language kivy language used describe user interfaces quickly easily properties kivy properties classes used link widget code user interface description uix uix module commonly contains widgets layouts quickly create user interface widgets widgets user interface components add program provide kind functionality example file browser buttons lists sliders layouts layouts used arrange widgets modules modules classes loaded kivy start kivy application config file used manage loading modules note kivy also write modules input events kivy input events essential part kivy architecture kivy abstract contains different input events touches mice tuio mouse mtdev hidinput we also add d onscreenposition individual input event all input types characterized instance touch class touch class instance one following three states down move up widgets input dispatching term widgets frequently used gui programming describe part program interacts user kivy widgets works object receives input events all widgets arranged form widget tree one widget may contain number child none child whenever new data available kivy sends one per touch every event first received root widget widget tree kivy installation windows install kivy windows first need install python anaconda
