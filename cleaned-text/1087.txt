concepts rpa tutorial designed beginners professionals tutorial gives introduction rpa along wide range rpa topics rpa features rpa applications rpa tools rpa examples rpa interview questions etc what rpa rpa stands robotic process automation technology used software tools automate human tasks manual rulebased repetitive typically like bot performs tasks much higher rate human alone rpa software bots never sleep make zero mistakes interact inhouse applications websites user portals etc log applications enter data open emails attachments calculate complete tasks log term robotic process automation creates picture physical robots laborintensive human physical tasks uploading unloading heavy goods vehicle cleaning house etc however reality picture completely different word robot rpa physical robot virtual system helps automating repetitive manual computing business process tasks rpa technologies divided three categories probots bots follow simple repeatable rules process data knowbots bots search userspecified information internet respond user chatbots bots act respond virtual agents reply customer queries realtime why rpa rpa part organizations infrastructure instead belongs top whole organizations infrastructure environment business processes smart intelligent many dependent multiple systems rarely interact types tasks repetitive timeconsuming laborintensive human beings robotic process automation takes large transformation plans implementation process automate types repetitive timeconsuming rulebased tasks quickly accurately tirelessly compared human rpa technology uses bots interact web applications web sites excel worksheets emails automate tasks like human rpa currently efficient automation solution helps human beings focus tasks require emotional intelligence reasoning judgement interactions customers rather repetitive tasks benefits rpa robotic process automation technology provides following benefits cost savings rpa helps organizations save huge amount cost typically cheaper hiring employee perform set tasks less error rpa works standard logic get bored distracted tired hence probability making errors reduces great extent means less rework enhanced reputation efficiency faster processing rpa works faster human employees computer software need breaks food rest etc perform repetitive operations tirelessly rpa processing time becomes predictable consistent ensures highquality customer service across operations better regulatory compliance rpa software works logic data fed needed per given instructions hence minimal chances complying standard regulations better customer service when rpa implemented business frees many employees spend time working customerrelated services beneficial businesses receive lot customer queries also leads increased productivity employees auditable secure rpa bots access data given permission create detailed audit trail activity low technical barrier rpa require programming skills configure software robot since codefree technology nontechnical person set bot using drag drop features also includes recorder record steps automation benefits rpa ensures overall higher level quality
