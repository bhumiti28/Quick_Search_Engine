control action derivative form controller output proportional error e time expressed output kd dedt where kd derivative gain output derivative controller depend past present error instead depends rate changing error derivative controller provide large corrective action large error occurs error constant corrective action cannot take place derivative controller needs care operation works small gain rapid change error derivative controller cause large sudden changes controller output characteristics derivative controller controller output zero error constant zero gives output error changing time lets consider example example consider system gs js rotational element j moment inertia depicts poles lies imaginary axis increase gain zero infinity response system case purely oscillatory
