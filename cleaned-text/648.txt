shortened quick response code alternative bar code say twodimensional barcode contains matrix small squares information stored works barcode read imaging device nowadays used lot every field geo location products vehicle tracking etc section learn generate read qr code java using zxing library qr code grid arrangement black squares white background read imaging device called qr code advantage qr code scanned smartphones we need carry handheld device scanning used store information text webpage url etc uses following four standardized encoding modes numeric alphanumeric bytebinary kanji japanese script standard encodings modes store data effectively quick response system became popular outside automotive industry due fast readability greater storage capacity compared standard upc barcodes how qr code work qr code made modules black white squares contain encoded data modules arranged row columns called data matrix placing data bits starts bottom right corner moves upward direction changes position reach top we scan qr code imaging device camera after scanning processes qr code using reedsolomon error correction code image interpreted after data extracted patterns stored horizontal vertical components code following figure describes structure qr code elements qr code components two primary components qr code ie function patterns encoding regions components divided small components following figure depicts components qr code following table describes component work components parts components description quite zone boundary qr code white space around qr code represents quiet zone function patterns positioning patterns also known finder patterns position markers finds edges qr code timing patterns helps scanner identify position rows columns sixth row column qr code dedicated timing pattern separator separates data finder pattern alignment patterns helps scanner identify reference point alignment encoding regions format information helps scanner identify types content text url etc contains data two parts ie level error correction masks pattern version information helps scanner identify version number qr code data modules helps scanner decode data entered creator error correction levels qr code scanned even damaged somewhat reedsolomon correction algorithm makes possible noted add error correction increases number data block qr code so need adjust level error correction according requirements four levels error correction following qr code represents error correction error correction levels capability level correction low l medium m quartile q high h how much data stored qr code data storage capacity qr code depends following three datatype mode input character set version different sizes qr error correction version denotes dimensions symbol ie version number dots side maximum character storage capacity encoding mode max characters bitschar possible characters default encoding numeric alphanumeric az uppercase space binarybyte iso kanjikana shift jis x note version number varies number rows columns also varies therefore stores higher information also notable qr code contains equal number rows columns number rows columns depends version number generating qr code generate qr code java need use thirdparty library named zxing zebra crossing popular api allows us process qr code help library easily generate read qr code before moving towards java program need add zxing library project we download official site zxing core jar zxing javase jar after downloading add classpath add following dependency pomxml
