interview quality assurance tutorial before proceed quality assurance terms acknowledged what quality quality defined product services fit use purpose quality meeting needs expectations customers concerning functionality design reliability durability price product what assurance assurance positive declaration product service product work well provides guarantee would work without problem according expectations requirements what quality assurance quality assurance also known qa testing qa defined activity ensure organization providing best product service customers software quality assurance seems evaluation software based functionality performance adaptability however software quality assurance goes beyond quality software also includes quality process used develop test release software software quality assurance software development lifecycle includes requirements management software design coding testing release management quality assurance set activities defines procedures standards develop product quality assurance systematic way creating environment ensure software product developed meets quality requirements process controlled determined managerial level preventive process whose aim establish correct methodology standard provide quality environment product developed quality assurance focuses process standard projects audit procedures development qa also known set activities designed evaluate process products manufactured qa focused improving processes deliver quality products what quality attribute software following six characteristics define quality software functionality quality software defined effectively software interacts components system software must provide appropriate functions per requirement functions must implemented correctly reliability defined capability software perform specific conditions specified duration usability usability software defined ease use quality software also identified easily user understand functions software much efforts required follow features efficiency efficiency software dependent architecture coding practice followed development maintainability maintainability also one significant factors define quality software refers identify fault fix software stable changes made portability portability software defined easily system adapts changes specifications quality software also determined portability system easy install software easy replace component order given environment ensure software score well quality attribute need following software quality assurance what software quality assurance components software quality assurance six classes components preproject plan preproject plan ensures resources required project schedule budget clearly defined plan development ensuring quality determined components required resources hardware human resources development plan schedules risk evaluation quality plan project methodology project lifecycle component project lifecycle usually comprised two stages development stage development stage component software quality assurance help identify design programming errors its components divided following subclasses reviews expert opinions software testing operation maintenance stage operation maintenance stage software quality assurance components include development lifecycle component along specialized components whose aim improve maintenance tasks infrastructure error prevention improvement components aim component prevention software faults minimizes rate errors components procedure work instructions templates checklists staff training retainingand certification preventive corrective actions configuration management documentation control software quality management components class component consists controlling development maintenance activities components establish managerial control software development projects management component aims prevent project going budget behind schedule management components include project progress control software quality metrics software quality costs standardization certification sqa assessment components aim components implement international managerial professional standards within organization components help improve coordination among organizational quality systems establish standards project process component includes

monitoring performance monitoring security testing monitoring customer support how quality assurance whole process quality assurance define cycle called pdca cycle phases cycle plan do check act plan organization plan establish process related objectives determine process required deliver highquality end product do development testing processes also change methods check monitoring processes modify methods check whether meets predetermined objectives act implement actions necessary achieve improvements process organization must use quality assurance ensure product designed implemented correct procedures help reduce problems errors final product what quality control quality control popularly abbreviated qc software engineering process used ensure quality product deal processed used create product instead examines quality end product outcome main aim quality control check whether product meets specification requirement customer issue identified what difference quality control quality
