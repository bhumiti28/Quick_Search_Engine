interface unixgnu linux system hence user execute different toolsutilities commands input data shell sends result user screen completed running program common output device thats known command interpreter shell command interpreter also shell programming language complete constructs programming language functions variables loops conditional execution many others reason gnuunix linux shell stronger windows shell broadly shell categorized two main categories explained graphical shells shells specifies manipulation programs based graphical user interface gui permitting operations like moving closing resizing opening windows switching focus among windows well ubuntu os windows os could examined good example offers graphical user interface user interact program various users dont need typing command actions commandline shell various shells could accessed help commandline interface users unique program known command prompt windows terminal macoslinux offered typing humanunderstandable commands like ls cat etc run result shown user terminal working commandline shell complicated many beginners due hard remember several commands commandline shell dominant permits users storing commands file run together way repetitive action could automated easily usually files known shell scripts macoslinux systems batch files windows various types shells discussed follows bash shell bash shell bash means bourne again shell default shell several distributions linux today shcompatible shell could installed windows os facilitates practical improvements sh interactive programming use contains job control commandline editing shell aliases functions unlimited size command history integer arithmetic base cshtcsh shell tcsh upgraded c shell shell used shell script command processor interactive login shell tcsh shell includes following characteristics c like syntax filename completion programmable word commandline editor job control spelling correction ksh shell ksh means korn shell developed designed david g korn ksh shell highlevel powerful complete programming language reciprocal command language well like various gnuunix linux shells usage syntax c shell c programming language zsh shell zsh shell developed reciprocal combines various aspects gnuunix linux shells like ksh tcsh bash also posix shell standard specifications based korn shell also strong scripting language like available shells some unique features listed follows startup files filename generation loginlogout watching concept index closing comments variable index key index function index various others could find within man pages all shells similar job take different commands facilitate distinct builtin functions fish fish stands friendly interactive shell produced fish shell developed fully userfriendly interactive like shells contains good features mentioned webbased configuration man page completions autosuggestions support term terminal automation completely scripted clean scripts shell prompt known command prompt issued via shell we type command prompt shown shell reads input click enter illustrates command want run seeing initial word input word defined characters unbroken set tabs spaces separate words common data command example shows current time date we also customize command prompt help ps environment variable shell scripting common concept shell script command list good shell script contain comments preceded via simbol shell functions scripts interpreted means arent compiled also conditional tests like value y greater value z loops permitting us proceed massive data amounts files store read data variables store read data scripts may contain functions shells usually interactive means receive commands input users run although sometimes routinely wish run set commands hence type within commands alltime inside terminal shell script includes syntax similarly programming languages when prior experience along programming language cc python etc easy begin shell script combines components functions control flow else shell loops case etc shell commands touch pwd echo ls cd etc shell keywords break else etc shell scripts need several causes write shell scripts avoiding automation repetitive work shell scripting used system admins many routine backups including new functionalities shell system monitoring etc shell script advantages syntax command exactly similar entered directly command line thus programmers dont switch completely different syntax interactive debugging quick start much quicker write shell scripts etc shell script disadvantages single error modify command could harmful prone costly errors design flaws language implementation syntax slower execution speed offer minimal data structure dissimilar scripting languages well suited complex large tasks etc script example assume make testsh script we alert system shell script started include anything else script note every script sh extension done help shebang construct example
