types design pattern java provides welldefined solutions commonly occurring problem application design represents detailed description application flow solution problem used many different situations boostsup development process providing tested proven development paradigm section focus visitor design patterns java visitor pattern type behavioral design pattern manages algorithms relationships responsibilities objects used perform operation group similar kinds objects runtime decouples operations object structure using visitor patterns easily add new behaviors existing class hierarchy without changing existing code sometimes also known behavioral pattern design patterns provide class object communication patterns specifically concerned communication objects therefore primary goal visitor pattern moves operational logic objects another class using visitor patterns achieve openclose principle according gof visitor design pattern defined representing operation performed elements object structure visitor lets define new operation without changing classes elements operates following figure describes concept visitor design patterns visitor pattern actually creates external class uses data classes we use pattern need perform operations across dispate set objects provides additional functionality class without modifying two important methods used visitor patterns accept method accepts visitor provided visitable class visit method called every time visit element implemented visitor class example visitor design pattern common example visitor pattern shopping supermarket supermarket pick goods add cart when collect necessary goods cart go bill desk billing cashier checks goods picked us tells us total amount pay here cashier acts visitor where use we use visitor design pattern application holds following conditions welldefined set classes visited operations said classes welldefined known advance example someone consuming api want give consumers way add new adhoc functionality objects theyre also convenient way extend sealed classes adhoc functionality you perform operations class objects want avoid runtime type testing usually case traverse hierarchy disparate objects different properties design components five major components visitor pattern client class acts consumer classes design pattern authority access data structure objects also instructs accept visitor performs appropriate processing visitor may interface abstract class interface contains visit operation types visitable classes concretevisitor all visit methods declared abstract visitor must implemented concretevisitor class each visitor responsible different operations visitable also interface declare accepted operation entry point enables object visited visitor object concretevisitable class implements visitable interface class accept operation defined object visitor class passed object using accept operation advantages we easily add items system changes required visitor interface other existing code affected logic operation changes need make changes visitor implementation reduces maintenance cost being relatively clean easytoread code typesafety type errors caught compile time provides high extensibility disadvantages difficult extend several implementations visitor interface while designing pattern emphasis return type visit method else change interface implementations implementation visitor design pattern java lets design pattern vehicles gone service visited inspector calculates service charge vehicle total service charges including vehicles following example first create two interfaces named vehicle vehicleinspector vehiclejava
