denormalization databases when normalize tables break multiple smaller tables so want retrieve data multiple tables need perform kind join operation case use denormalization technique eliminates drawback normalization denormalization technique used database administrators optimize efficiency database infrastructure method allows us add redundant data normalized database alleviate issues database queries merge data several tables single table denormalization concept based definition normalization defined arranging database tables correctly particular purpose note denormalization indicate normalization optimization strategy used normalization achieved example we two table students branch performing normalization student table attributes rollno studname age branchid additionally branch table related student table branchid student tables foreign key join operation two tables needed need retrieve student names well branch name suppose want change student name great table small issue tables big joins tables take excessively long time case well update database denormalization redundancy extra effort maximize efficiency benefits fewer joins therefore add branch names data branch table student table optimizing database pros denormalization following advantages denormalization enhance query performance fetching queries normalized database generally requires joining large number tables already know joins slower query overcome add redundancy database copying values parent child tables minimizing number joins needed query make database convenient manage normalized database required calculated values applications calculating values onthefly take longer time slowing execution query thus denormalization fetching queries simpler need look fewer tables facilitate accelerate reporting suppose need certain statistics frequently requires long time create live data slows entire system suppose want monitor client revenues certain year clients generating reports live data require searching throughout entire database significantly slowing cons denormalization following disadvantages denormalization takes large storage due data redundancy makes expensive updates inserts data table makes update inserts code harder write since data modified several ways makes data inconsistent hence well need update every piece duplicate data its also used measure values produce reports we using triggers transactions andor procedures operations must performed together how denormalization different normalization denormalization different normalization following manner denormalization technique used merge data multiple tables single table queried quickly normalization hand used delete redundant data database replace nonredundant reliable data denormalization used joins costly queries run regularly tables normalization hand typically used large number insertupdatedelete operations performed joins tables expensive next topicer model vs
