provides basic advanced concepts appium automation testing tool our appium tutorial designed beginners professionals tutorial going discuss following topic what appium features appium appium architecture advantages appium disadvantages appium how appium works types mobile application prerequisite use appium installation appium windows os limitation appium competitors appium appium vs robotium appium vs selendroid what appium appium opensource automation mobile testing tool used test application developed supported sauce labs automate native hybrid mobile apps crossplatform mobile automation tool means allows test run multiple platforms multiple devices easily tested appium parallel todays development area demand mobile applications high currently people converting websites mobile apps therefore important know mobile software automation testing technology also stay connected new technology appium mobile application testing tool currently trending mobile automation testing technology appium used automated testing native hybrid web applications supports automation test simulators ios emulators android well physical devices android ios previously tool mainly focused ios android applications limited mobile application testing few updates back appium declared would support desktop application testing windows well appium much similar selenium webdriver testing tool so already know selenium webdriver appium becomes easy learn appium dependency mobile device os framework converts selenium webdriver commands uiautomator uiautomation commands android ios respectively depends device type rather os type supports several languages java php objective c c python javascript nodejs ruby many selenium client libraries selenium backend appium provides control functionality selenium testing needs features appium appium require application source code library appium provides strong active community appium multiplatform support ie run test cases multiple platforms appium allows parallel execution test scripts appium small change require reinstallation application appium supports various languages like c python java ruby php javascript nodejs many others selenium client library advantages appium appium opensource tool means freely available easy install allows automated testing hybrid native web applications unlike testing tools need include additional agents app make appium compatible automation tests app going upload app store additional feature added appium now would support desktop application testing windows well along mobile application testing appium crossplatform freely available mobile testing tool allows us crossplatform mobile testing means test multiple platforms single api android ios platforms disadvantages appium along features advantages appium drawbacks follows lack detailed reports since tests depend remote web driver bit slow limitation overhead appium uses uiautomator android supports android sdk api higher however appium supports older apis directly uses another opensource library selendroid support older apis ios one instance ios script run one mac os device means one test executed time per mac want run tests multiple ios devices time need arrange number mac machines would expensive arrange various mac machines solution problem resolved run script mobile cloud sauce lab currently allows scripts run multiple ios simulators time appium architecture appium http server written nodejs starts test case device gives rise server listens proxied commands main appium server tester writes test scripts execute device emulator several webdriver sessions different platforms like android ios created handled appium test scripts written tester executes emulator device sending requests appium server each vendor ios android different method mechanism execute test cases device so test case executes listening commands appium server appium uses json wire protocols send command requests appium server how appium work when install appium server also installed machine exposes rest api receives command connection requests client executes command devices like ios android replies http responses execute requests uses mobile test automation framework run user interface app example apple instruments used ios selendroid used android api less uiautomator used android api higher remember appium uses another opensource library selendroid support older apis uiautomator supports api higher now discuss appium works different platforms appium android android appium proxies command uiautomator script running device uiautomator native ui automation framework android allows run junit test cases directly device using command line although uses java programming language appium allows run webdriver supported language android uses bootstrapjar works tcp server used send test commands perform actions android device using uiautomator figure see appium architecture respect android automation appium ios android uses uiautomator ios uses uiautomation similar android appium proxies command uiautomation test case running mac instruments environment apple provides application instrument performs various activities like building profiling controlling ios apps hand also automation component write commands javascript uses uiautomation api interact application ui appium uses libraries automate ios apps figure see appium architecture respect ios automation note diagram bootstrapjs used place bootstrapjar performs actions aut application under test types mobile applications discussed earlier appium ability deal sorts applications ie native hybrid web lets understand details native applications native applications software programs developed keeping certain platform mind applications developed using specific software development kit native apps developed use specific device installed app store google play store apples app store work offline also use device notification system some native application examples pinterest skype snapchat etc web applications web applications real applications websites run browsers applications developed using html css javascript low price unlike android ios apps require software development kit sdk developers work web applications developed particular platform since web applications run web browsers dont require installation some web application examples flipkart ali express twitter etc hybrid applications hybrid application combination native web applications like native applications applications downloaded app store also take advantage device features actually web applications inside developed using web development languages html css javascript like hybrid app allows run platform some hybrid application examples ola instagram basecamp etc prerequisites use appium install java jdk install android studio install additional android sdk tools install appium jar file js required default comes nodejs npm whenever appium server installed therefore required install nodejs npm separately already included current version appium install appium desktop client install eclipse ide java appium installation windows setting appium installation single tool setting variables complete setup appium requires installation many tools appium starts testing application tutorial mainly focuses appium setup android windows operating system install setup java appium need write automation test scripts interact mobile screen control fields text boxes buttons etc mobile application also perform actions java used write automation test scripts so download latest version jdk setup environment variable download latest version java setup java environment variable install setup android studio one time taking step download install android studio may cause errors appium done properly downloading android studio many changes need setup here would recommend download latest version android studio download android studio download latest version android studio clicking link double click downloaded exe file run complete installation process continue default options finish installation process android studio takes time install install additional android sdk tools after complete installation android studio see main panel android studio given screenshot click configure dropdown menu bottom right corner select sdk manager default screen open android sdk sdk platform check latest version android installed you also use another android version working real android device page switch sdk tools check marked components installedupdated mark checkbox install setup android environment variable step step installation appium desktop client now installing java android studio setting environment variables install appium desktop client appium studio gui app install appium server comes prerequirements installing using appium server inspector used get basic information mobile app steps installing appium desktop client windows follow step go following link httpappiumio click download appium button step windows os download exe file appium desktop setup so click file shown screenshot step after downloading exe file double click downloaded file run note window os dont need install appium runs exe file directly whereas need install dmg mac machine step here need choose installation options you select users multiple users system otherwise select administrator system after choosing installation option click install button start installation may take time install step appium successfully installed system completing appium setup click finish button note run appium checked start appium desktop step now appium desktop ui appear screen containing default host port changed default host default port click start server button start appium server step new server launch host port specified previous step you see message top screen server running step go file click new session window step
