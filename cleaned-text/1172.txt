cell membrane endoplasmic reticulum golgi body mitochondria lysosome peroxisome plastids ribosomes nucleus what dna dna structure nucleotide chromosome giant chromosomes what gene types genes genetic code codon protein synthesis next prev mitochondria cell organelle mitochondria singular mitochondrion doublemembrane bound cell organelles like chloroplast nucleus mostly found eukaryotic cells referred powerhouse cell produce atp adenosine triphosphate cellular respiration atp energy molecule source energy provides energy cell perform various biochemical reactions mitochondria discovered kolliker flight muscles insects term mitochondria given benda mitochondria chloroplast present plant cells organelles contain dna furthermore mitochondria replicate dna genetic material ribosomes build proteins due ability replicate also known semiautonomous body number mitochondria number mitochondria varies cell cell depending activities cell cell active number mitochondria example cells flight muscle insects may contain lakh mitochondria number giant amoeba however unicellular organisms like chlamydomonas chlorella contain one mitochondrion structure mitochondria generally disc ovalshaped organelle enclosed double membrane inner mitochondrial membrane outer mitochondrial membrane space theses membranes called intermembrane space outer compartment whereas space enclosed inner membrane called inner compartment inner surface inner membrane towards matrix called m face whereas outer surface towards outer space called c face cytosol face outer membrane porous contains fewer proteins permeable nature inner membrane folded folds proteins semipermeable nature folds inner membrane called cristae singular crista material present inner compartment called matrix pale yellow colour due presence riboflavin matrix contains enzymes required cellular respiration also rich divalent ions like mg ions mn ions fe ions ions act activators enzymes take part cellular respiration besides circular dna ribosomes also present matrix s ribosomes found prokaryotes what oxysome important structure present mitochondria present surface inner membrane mitochondria oxysomes also known f f particles elementary particles structures help synthesis atp oxysomes present inner membrane surface mainly crista structure oxysome oxysome three parts bottom base part embedded membrane known f particle second part extends base protein known f f particle stock part third part enlarged also protein attached stock part known f particles head oxysome head part acts atpase helps synthesis atp due reason also known atp synthetase number oxysome also varies mitochondrion depending activity cell how atp produced mitochondria proteins inner membrane act electron transport chain when electrons move chain pair protons h pumped matrix outer compartment so due high concentration protons outer space protons tend move matrix high energy protons move oxysome enter base oxysome when arrive head oxysome use high energy protons add inorganic phosphate adp form atp so energy needed produce atp produced protons move back matrix gradient intermembrane space every one pair protons move matrix oxysome one atp synthesized head acts enzyme reason mitochondria called powerhouse cell oxysome atp synthesized mitochondria thus cellular respiration occurs mitochondria converts glucose oxygen adenosine triphosphate atp produces energy energy used cell cell cannot work without energy so atp known biochemical energy currency cell functions mitochondria main function mitochondria perform cellular respiration produce energy carries oxidation food using oxygen produces energy used form produce atp energy currency cells cellular respiration process takes nutrients cell converts energy used cell perform various functions also converts food nutrients molecules proteins carbohydrates etc also eliminates wastes cells mitochondria liver cells enzymes detoxify ammonia causes cytoplasmic inheritance mitochondrial dna passes eggs cytoplasm zygote fertilization egg sperm site citric acid cycle krebs cycle occurs maintains calcium homeostasis concentration calcium ions cell example calcium flow mitochondria known mitochondrial calcium exchange thus helps metabolic regulation apoptosis programmed cell death old damaged cells releases proteins like cytochrome c response various types cell stress heat infection calcium nutrient deficiency also aids making certain parts blood hormones estrogen testosterone perform thermogenesis production heat proton leak helps growth multiplication cells example organ stress performing specific task mitochondria multiply help organ also helps synthesis heme ironcontaining part part haemoglobin myoglobin next topiclysosome prev
