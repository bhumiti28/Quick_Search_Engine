replaces msata standard uses pci express mini physical card layout connectors m ssd gives flexible physical specifications m allows different module widths lengths advanced interfacing features m suitable msata solidstate storage applications especially smaller devices ultrabooks tablets three types m available nvme nonvolatile memory express nvm express created nextgeneration ssds while nvme storage available standard pcie connections desktop motherboards m form factor uses different connector sata uses ahci driver routes sata port via m connector slow widely compatible ahci slower option lowbudget motherboards suited older operating systems ssds connected via ahci typically behave like dram standard hard disk drive hdd ssds form storage media saves persistent data solidstate flash memory ssd moving parts break spin like hard disk drive hdd initially m ssd specification known nextgeneration form factor nextgeneration name changed mdot m computer bus interfaces provided m connector m host module manufacturer select interfaces must supported depending desired level host support device type m connector keying notches denote various purposes capabilities m hosts devices unique key notches m modules also prevent inserted incompatible host connectors m ssd form factor m drives connected motherboard via cable theyre instead plugged directly motherboard using dedicated m connector slot m ssds rectangular shape generally millimeters wide usually mm mm long although card lengths different card size identified four fivedigit number first two digits width remaining numbers length example card mm wide mm long longer length m drives usually hold nand chips extra capacity shorter versions other sizes include x mm x mm x mm x mm x mm mm width important note standard desktops laptops mm mm length card hold nand chips tb capacity what does m ssd look like well two types m find differences connectors you must buy right type m ssd motherboard connection three configurations available differ notchs position edge connector gap b notch six pins left m notch five pins right bm features two notches first six pins left second five pins right you need take care check motherboard documentation purchasing m ssd mistake could expensive m ssd module keys keys notches edge connectors m modules distinguish types m products m ssd modules plug circuit boards mating connectors either side two types connectors sockets b key sockets m key sockets key determines number pcie lanes socket supports b key holds one two pci express lanes m key holds four pcie lanes b key

drive disconnect computer mains youre installing m ssd device laptop remove battery now follow following steps step select m ssd want start identifying m ssd storage device based motherboard requirements port key difficult aspect process thats make right choice based motherboard size requirement budget step identify m connector some motherboards multiple m ports one might network card device alternatively motherboard might specific configuration optimum use you might four sata drives example requiring using specific m port therefore important check motherboard documentation confirm port connect m ssd step m connector try adapter motherboard misses m slot purchase pcie adapter card m slot relatively inexpensive youre thinking buying m ssd pcie adapters available laptops usb enclosures m ssds available isnt ideal useless booting operating systems good option ultrafast storage perhaps highdefinition video editing remember buying adapter ensure key matches m ssd youre buying otherwise incompatible step install m ssd drive when youre ready install m ssd drive begin removing securing screw port use philips head screwdriver sticking blob adhesive putty good option next ensure ssd drive connector match slide port degree angle cases slide without much effort may need twist little secure m ssd drive push motherboard line screw tighten note position screw depend length m ssd several holes available support different ssd sizes take care overtighten ssd damage replace pcs case boot step enable m biosuefi youll need enable m device pcs settings boot straight biosuefi screen look m option related pci express slot check motherboard manual correct steps differ manufacturer manufacturer device enabled opt install windows whatever operating system prefer m ssd
