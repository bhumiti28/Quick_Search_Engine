fuzzy logic tutorial javatpoint home java fuzzy logic javascript bootstrap c html xhtml css jquery xml json comment forum training fuzzy logic tutorial fuzzy logic tutorial fuzzy logic tutorial what fuzzy logic fuzzy word means things clear vague sometimes cannot decide real life given problem statement either true false time concept provides many values true false gives flexibility find best solution problem example fuzzy logic comparing boolean logic fuzzy logic contains multiple logical values values truth values variable problem concept introduced lofti zadeh based fuzzy set theory concept provides possibilities given computers similar range possibilities generated humans boolean system two possibilities exist denotes absolute truth value denotes absolute false value fuzzy system multiple possibilities present partially false partially true fuzzy logic implemented systems microcontrollers workstationbased large networkbased systems achieving definite output also implemented hardware software characteristics fuzzy logic following characteristics fuzzy logic concept flexible easily understand implement used helping minimization logics created human best method finding solution problems suitable approximate uncertain reasoning always offers two values denote two possible solutions problem statement allows users build create functions nonlinear arbitrary complexity fuzzy logic everything matter degree fuzzy logic system logical easily fuzzified based natural language processing also used quantitative analysts improving algorithms execution also allows users integrate programming architecture fuzzy logic system architecture fuzzy logic system component plays important role architecture consists different four components given rule base fuzzification inference engine defuzzification following diagram shows architecture process fuzzy logic system rule base rule base component used storing set rules ifthen conditions given experts used controlling decisionmaking systems many updates come fuzzy theory recently offers effective methods designing tuning fuzzy controllers updates developments decreases number fuzzy set rules fuzzification fuzzification module component transforming system inputs ie converts crisp number fuzzy steps crisp numbers inputs measured sensors fuzzification passed control systems processing component divides input signals following five states fuzzy logic system large positive lp medium positive mp small s medium negative mn large negative ln inference engine component main component fuzzy logic system fls information processed inference engine allows users find matching degree current fuzzy input rules after matching degree system determines rule added according given input field when rules fired combined developing control actions defuzzification defuzzification module component takes fuzzy set inputs generated inference engine transforms crisp value last step process fuzzy logic system crisp value type value acceptable user various techniques present user select best one reducing errors membership function membership function function represents graph fuzzy sets allows users quantify linguistic term graph used mapping element x value function also known indicator characteristics function function membership introduced first papers fuzzy set zadeh fuzzy set b membership function x defined bx function x element set b mapped value called degree membership membership value classical fuzzy set theory learn classical fuzzy set theory firstly know set set set term collection unordered ordered elements following various examples set set allnatural numbers set students class set cities state set uppercase letters alphabet types set following various categories set finite empty infinite proper universal subset singleton equivalent set disjoint set classical set type set collects distinct objects group sets crisp boundaries classical sets set single entity called element member set mathematical representation sets any set easily denoted following two different ways roaster form also called tabular form form set represented following way setname element element element element n elements set enclosed within brackets separated commas following two examples describes set roaster tabular form example set natural numbers n n example set prime numbers less x set builder form set builder form defines set common properties element set form set represented following way xpx following example describes set builder form set written b x x x operations classical set following various operations performed classical sets union operation intersection operation difference operation complement operation union operation denoted u b u b set elements exist two different sets b operation combines elements sets make new set also called logical operation described b x x x b example set set b b intersection operation denoted b b set elements common set b also called logical operation described b x x x b example set set b b difference operation operation denoted b ab set elements exist set set b described b x x x b complement operation operation denoted applied
