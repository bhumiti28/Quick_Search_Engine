james gosling sun microsystems multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev database schema database schema structure represents logical storage data database represents organization data provides information relationships tables given database topic understand database schema types before understanding database schema lets first understand database what database database place store information store simplest data list people well complex data database stores information wellstructured format what database schema database schema logical representation database shows data stored logically entire database contains list attributes instruction informs database engine data organized elements related database schema contains schema objects may include tables fields packages views relationships primary key foreign key actual data physically stored files may unstructured form retrieve use need put structured form database schema used provides knowledge data organized database associated data schema physically contain data instead gives information shape data related tables models database schema object includes following consistent formatting data entries database objects unique keys data entries tables multiple columns column contains name datatype complexity size schema vary per size project helps developers easily manage structure database coding given diagram example database schema contains three tables data types also represents relationships tables primary keys well foreign keys types database schema database schema divided three types logical schema physical schema view schema physical database schema physical database schema specifies data stored physically storage system disk storage form files indices designing database physical level called physical schema logical database schema logical database schema specifies logical constraints need applied stored data defines views integrity constraints table here term integrity constraints define set rules used dbms database management system maintain quality insertion update data logical schema represents data stored form tables attributes table linked together level programmers administrators work implementation data structure hidden level various tools used create logical database schema tools demonstrate relationships component data process called er modelling er modelling stands entityrelationship modelling specifies relationships different entities we understand example basic commerce application below schema diagram simple er model representing logical flow transaction commerce application given example ids given circle ids primary key foreign keys primary key used uniquely identify entry document record ids upper three circles primary keys foreign key used primary key tables fk represent foreign key diagram relates one table another table view schema view level design database known view schema schema generally describes enduser interaction database systems difference physical logical database schema physical database schema logical database schema include attributes includes attributes contains primary secondary keys also contains primary secondary keys contains table name contains names tables contains column names data types contain column name datatype database instance database schema terms database schema database instances related sometimes confusing used thing different database schema representation planned database actually contain data hand database instance type snapshot actual database existed instance time hence varies changed per time contrast database schema static complex change structure database both instances schemas related impact dbms dbms ensures every database instance complies constraints imposed database designers database schema creating schema create schema create schema statements used type database dbms different meaning below explaining creating schema different database systems mysql mysql create schema statement creates database mysql create schema statement similar create database statement schema synonym database oracle database oracle database schema already present database user hence create schema actually create schema rather helps show schema tables views allows access objects without requiring multiple sql statements multiple transactions create user statement used create schema oracle sql server sql server create schema statement creates new schema name provided user database schema designs schema design first step building foundation data management ineffective schema designs difficult manage consume memory resources logically depends business requirements required choose correct database schema design make ease project lifecycle list popular database schema designs given flat model hierarchical model network model relational model star schema snowflake schema flat model flat model schema type d array column contains type data elements within row related understood single spreadsheet database table relations schema design suitable small applications dont contain complex data hierarchical model hierarchical model design contains treelike structure tree structure contains root node data child nodes between child node parent node onetomany relationship type database schemas presented xml json files files contain entities subentities hierarchical schema models best suitable storing nested data representing hominoid classification network model network model design similar hierarchical design represents series nodes vertices main difference network model hierarchical model network model allows manytomany relationship contrast hierarchical model allows onetomany relationship network model design best suitable applications require spatial calculations also great representing workflows mainly cases multiple paths result relational model relational models used relational database stores data relations table relational operators used operate data manipulate calculate different values star schema star schema different way schema design organize data best suitable storing analysing huge amount data works facts dimensions here fact numerical data point runs business processes dimension description fact star schema structure data rdbms snowflake schema snowflake schema adaption star
