james gosling sun microsystems multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types thermometer invention thermometer become useful various industries however important development medical practices health industry thermometers become integral tool properly measuring body temperature medical field ultimately helps taking appropriate steps care getting ideas diagnose related conditions however many types thermometers choose right one help measuring temperature properly therefore necessary know different thermometers choosing particular one personal laboratory preferences article discussing major types thermometers applications lets quick overview thermometers what thermometer thermometer refers specific type instrument primarily used measure temperature objects words thermometer specific device designed primarily measure temperature gradient meaning degree hotness coldness objects typical thermometer consists two primary components temperature sensor numerical reading make temperature measurement visible numerical value thermometer first introduced german physicist daniel gabriel fahrenheit he also called father thermometers important note thermometers measure temperatures heat heat mainly refers form energy temperature mathematical representation heat temperature usually measured kelvin k celsius c fahrenheit f properties thermometric liquid thermometers typically include liquids usually mercury indicate temperature objects liquid called thermometric liquid liquid used thermometers must basic properties thermal expansion liquid used inside thermometer uniform freezing point low traditional thermometers liquid visible indicate temperature level objects properly note mercury considered best thermometric liquid due highest coefficient expansion means remains liquid form temperature levels therefore used measuring high temperatures furthermore stick thermometers glass surface luminous appearance making temperature readings clear types thermometer thermometers available wide variety based specific requirements discussed mainly help measure temperature objects living nonliving therefore one particular set thermometers used measure body temperatures contrast another set thermometers used measure boiling point temperatures freezing points experiments laboratory tests based needs thermometers broadly classified following two categories clinical thermometers laboratory thermometers let us discuss type detail clinical thermometers clinical thermometers also called medical thermometers particularly designed clinical purposes thermometers used measure temperature human body basic clinical thermometer made using long narrow glass tube bulb containing mercury end mercurylevel indicates temperature human body mercury toxic element act poison therefore thermometers replaced modern thermometers digital measure temperature without even touching body always recommended sterilize thermometers use average temperature human body c fluctuate c c therefore clinical thermometers designed temperature range c c following different types clinical thermometers use daily measure body temperature digital thermometer digital thermometers typically operate using heat sensors help determine temperature human body also contain electronic circuit display screen display temperature readings used record readings tongue armpit rectum digital thermometers advanced type thermometers types thermometers considered accurate type thermometers used accurately furthermore easy use inexpensive easily available electronic ear thermometer electronic ear thermometers designed determine body temperature inside ear canal using infrared technology since measure temperature using tympanic membrane inside ear also known tympanic thermometers thermometers best suited children however expensive may correctly measure body temperature thermometer placed properly ear much wax inside ear electronic ear thermometers measure body temperature using infrared energy given heat source therefore thermometers quick capture body temperatures forehead thermometer just like electronic ear thermometers forehead thermometers also read heat using infrared technology capture superficial temporal arterys temperature subbranch carotid artery using infrared sensors thermometers modern become popular measuring peoples temperatures airports stations stores stadiums primary reason popularity noncontact behavior means forehead thermometers require physical contact taking temperature readings forehead thermometers also accurate traditional digital thermometers temperature readings thermometers usually run around f c cooler digital thermometers pacifier thermometer pacifier thermometers primarily designed babies older three months baby comfortable using pacifier easiest way determine body temperature although pacifier thermometers easy use precisely accurate capture approximate body temperatures need baby still couple minutes measuring body temperate struggle sometimes result inaccurate temperature readings plastic strip thermometer plastic strip thermometers effective measuring body temperatures provide exact temperature readings thermometers like tests thermometers act indication help determine presence fever humans we must put strip forehead use plastic strip thermometers colors strip change accordingly body temperature color changes danger chances presence fever thermometers cannot trusted also disposable singlephase thermometers mercury thermometer mercury thermometers basic thermometers option available measure body temperature accurate thermometers used similarly digital thermometers however thermometers use battery electronic circuits display mercury thermometers made glass tube various temperature reading mercury liquid form filled inside glass one end when put thermometer tongue mercury starts rising according body temperature once mercury stops corresponding reading body temperature however mercury thermometers longer widely used due safety concerns mercury poisoning illegal countries laboratory thermometers because cannot use clinical thermometers measuring temperatures human body therefore specific thermometers available measuring temperatures purposes more specifically laboratory thermometers type thermometer used measure temperatures body temperatures thermometers also sometimes known lab thermometers help measure boiling points freezing points many objects temperatures labs testing laboratory temperatures purposely designed lab purposes therefore never used clinical medical purposes besides maximumminimum thermometers help weather analyzers measure maximum minimum temperatures specific location laboratory thermometers generally come temperature range c c wide range laboratory thermometers depending variety temperature measurements following common types liquidinglass thermometer name suggests liquidinglass thermometers constructed using sealed glass containing liquid mercury red alcohol volume liquids thermometers changes according temperature when temperature increases liquid expands accordingly helps indicate temperature rinsing level liquid glass tube due glass tube thermometers fragile therefore mounted within protective housings temperature readings printed furthermore liquidinglass thermometers handy cheaper best suited areas electrical problem require power supply battery bimetallic strip thermometer bimetallic strip thermometers made using two different metals metals bonded expand different rates feel increase temperature two metals used thermometers also expand different lengths therefore bimetallic strip typically bends curls towards relevant side lower thermal expansion coefficient soon bimetallic strip moves deflects pointer calibrated scale helps determine corresponding temperature moreover bimetallic thermometers rigid inexpensive easy install use thermocouple thermometer thermocouple thermometers made electrical circuits surrounded boxshaped casing two wires different metals attached upper sides two ends one wirejunction placed object one placed constant lower temperature since wirejunction connected measuring instrument temperature difference forms electromotive force almost proportional difference temperatures junctions measured temperature displayed instrument thermometers generally used measure temperatures k thermocouple thermometers also referred thermal junction thermoelectric thermometer pyrometer thermometer pyrometer thermometers pyrometers remotesensing devices help capture temperatures distant objects thermometers typically determine objects temperatures based thermal radiation emitted one main advantages thermometers need touch objects therefore pyrometers best suited measuring temperatures moving objects surfaces moreover also helpful measuring objects temperatures cannot touched due complex structure higher temperatures pyrometers generally used measure temperatures greater k platinum resistance thermometer platinum resistance thermometers typically measure temperature using platinum wire wire connected electrical resistance changes based nearest temperature means resistance material used thermometers increases increase temperature platinum resistance temperatures mainly designed determine outside temperatures although temperature accuracy quite good thermometers bit slow types thermometers generally used measure temperatures ranges k k probe thermometer probe thermometers one common widely used types thermometers mainly used take instant temperature readings foods liquids samples thermometers instant temperature readings make ideal catering trade hygiene testing retail outlets laboratories probe thermometers typically contain pointed tip helps thermometers penetration immersion probes available two types fixed probes wired probes thermometers which type thermometer accurate measuring body temperature choosing best accurate thermometer always important thermometer use comfortably usually best one however digital thermometers always preferred thermometers many medical professionals comes accuracy crucial use thermometer properly otherwise reading might correct temperature readings usually vary thermometers based used digital thermometers measure body
