kubernetes tutorial javatpoint home java kubernetes linux jquery compiler coa html css selenium servlet jsp quiz projects interview q comment forum training kubernetes tutorial kubernetes tutorial kubernetes tutorial what kubernetes kubernetes also known k s word comes greek language means pilot helmsman kubernetes extensible portable opensource platform designed google mainly used automate deployment scaling operations containerbased applications across cluster nodes also designed managing services containerized apps using different methods provide scalability predictability high availability actually enhanced version borg managing longrunning processes batch jobs nowadays many cloud services offer kubernetesbased infrastructure deployed platformproviding service technique concept works many container tools like docker follows clientserver architecture key objects kubernetes following key objects exist kubernetes pod smallest simplest basic unit kubernetes application object indicates processes running cluster node node nothing single host used run virtual physical machines node kubernetes cluster also known minion service service kubernetes logical set pods works together help services users easily manage load balancing configurations replicaset replicaset kubernetes used identify particular number pod replicas running given time replaces replication controller powerful allows user use setbased label selector namespace kubernetes supports various virtual clusters known namespaces way dividing cluster resources two users features kubernetes following essential features kubernetes pod deployment unit kubernetes single internet protocol address horizontal scaling important feature kubernetes feature uses horizontalpodautoscalar automatically increase decrease number pods deployment replication controller replica set stateful set basis observed cpu utilization automatic bin packing kubernetes helps user declare maximum minimum resources computers containers service discovery load balancing kubernetes assigns ip addresses name dns set containers also balances load across automated rollouts rollbacks using rollouts kubernetes distributes changes updates application configuration problem occurs system technique rollbacks changes immediately persistent storage kubernetes provides essential feature called persistent storage storing data cannot lost pod killed rescheduled kubernetes supports various storage systems storing data google compute engines persistent disks gce pd amazon elastic block storage ebs also provides distributed file systems nfs gfs selfhealing feature plays important role concept kubernetes those containers failed execution process kubernetes restarts automatically containers reply userdefined health check stops working automatically kubernetes architecture architecture kubernetes actually follows clientserver architecture consists following two main components master node control plane slaveworker node master node kubernetes control plane master node kubernetes architecture used manage states cluster actually entry point types administrative tasks kubernetes cluster one master node present checking fault tolerance following four different components exist master node kubernetes control plane api server scheduler controller manager etcd api server kubernetes api server receives rest commands sent user after receiving validates rest requests process executes after execution rest commands resulting state cluster saved etcd distributed keyvalue store scheduler scheduler master node schedules tasks worker nodes every worker node used store resource usage information words process responsible assigning pods available worker nodes controller manager controller manager also known controller daemon executes nonterminating control loops controllers master node perform task manage state cluster kubernetes controller manager executes various types controllers handling nodes endpoints etc etcd opensource simple distributed keyvalue storage used store cluster data part master node written go programming language now learned functioning components master node lets see function slaveworker node components workerslave node worker node kubernetes also known minions worker node physical machine executes applications using pods contains essential services allow user assign resources scheduled containers following different components presents worker slave node kubelet component agent service executes worker node cluster ensures pods containers running smoothly every kubelet worker node communicates master node also starts stops maintains containers organized pods directly master node kubeproxy proxy service kubernetes executed simply worker node cluster main aim component request forwarding each node interacts kubernetes services kubeproxy pods pod combination one containers logically execute together nodes one worker node easily execute multiple pods installation kubernetes linux installation kubernetes linux straight forward process follow steps install kubernetes installation kubernetes step mandatory step step update necessary dependencies system using two commands first command used get updates execute following command terminal ask enter systems password
