tutorial provides basic advanced concepts docker our docker tutorial designed beginners well professionals docker centralized platform packaging deploying running applications before docker many users face problem particular code running developers system users system so main reason develop docker help developers develop applications easily ship containers deployed anywhere docker firstly released march used deployment stage software development life cycle thats efficiently resolve issues related application deployment what docker docker opensource centralized platform designed create deploy run applications docker uses container hosts operating system run applications allows applications use linux kernel system host computer rather creating whole virtual operating system containers ensure application works environment like development test production docker includes components docker client docker server docker machine docker hub docker composes etc lets understand docker containers virtual machine docker containers docker containers lightweight alternatives virtual machine allows developers package application libraries dependencies ship single package advantage using docker container dont need allocate ram disk space applications automatically generates storage space according application requirement virtual machine virtual machine software allows us install use operating systems windows linux debian simultaneously machine operating system virtual machine runs called virtualized operating systems virtualized operating systems run programs preforms tasks perform real operating system containers vs virtual machine containers virtual machine integration container faster cheap integration virtual slow costly wastage memory wastage memory uses kernel different distribution uses multiple independent operating systems why docker docker designed benefit developer system administrator following reasons use docker docker allows us easily install run software without worrying setup dependencies developers use docker eliminate machine problems ie code worked laptop working code together coworkers operators use docker run manage apps isolated containers better compute density enterprises use docker securely built agile software delivery pipelines ship new application features faster securely since docker used deployment also great platform development thats efficiently increase customers satisfaction advantages docker following advantages docker runs container seconds instead minutes uses less memory provides lightweight virtualization require full operating system run applications uses application dependencies reduce risk docker allows use remote repository share container others provides continuous deployment testing environment disadvantages docker following disadvantages docker increases complexity due additional layer docker difficult manage large amount containers some features container self registration containers selfinspects copying files form host container missing docker docker good solution applications require rich graphical interface docker provides crossplatform compatibility means application designed run docker container windows cant run linux vice versa docker engine client server application contains following major components server type longrunning program called daemon process rest api used specify interfaces programs use talk daemon instruct command line interface client prerequisite before learning docker must fundamental knowledge linux programming languages java php python ruby etc
