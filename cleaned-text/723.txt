projects branch bound algorithm last updated dec branch bound algorithm design paradigm generally used solving combinatorial optimization problems problems typically exponential terms time complexity may require exploring possible permutations worst case branch bound algorithm technique solves problems relatively quickly let us consider knapsack problem understand branch bound many algorithms knapsack problem solved greedy algorithm fractional knapsack dp solution knapsack backtracking solution knapsack lets see branch bound approach solve knapsack problem backtracking solution optimized know bound best possible solution subtree rooted every node best subtree worse current best simply ignore node subtrees so compute bound best solution every node compare bound current best solution
