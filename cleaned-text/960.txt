host machine run software use guest systemdesigned peripheral devices emulation termed ability computer programme replicate imitate another programme system within electronic device example several printers designed imitate hp laserjet printers since much software hp printers written nonbranded printer emulates branded printer nonbranded printer emulation also run programme written real branded printer even generate equivalent printing order play classic forgotten arcade games used established market gaming industry many video games fans using emulators since s before using original computer code data games interpreted currentera device emulates old video game consoles however difficult practise particularly exact behaviour device emulated recorded must deduced reverse engineering preservation process digital preservation emulation technique overcoming obsolescence main focus recreation original computer environment done true desire retain closer relation maintain authenticity digital object further timeconsuming difficult accomplish returns useful process emulation addresses digital objects original hardware practically speaking new version specific application launched instead fixing compatibility problems migration digital object created previous version application application emulator may created allow access digital objects advantages emulator certainly major benefits points points surlily serve purpose keeping points mentioned easily know benefit emulator some benefit using emulator potentially better original hardware graphics output initial hardware added features emulators retain digital objects original look feel behaviour almost significant digital data helps reducing working hours pre stored libraries emulator developed released opensource environment so emulator comes usually general public license abbreviated gpl short licencing allows one broad scale collaboration emulators make possible use software exclusive one device another obstacles emulator everything benefit successful also obstacles also developer needs focus points specially make product better obstacles far intellectual property during programme growth several technology vendors introduced nonstandard features create position market simultaneously applying ongoing updates stay competitive copyright protections make design emulators difficult must sufficiently accurate prevent triggering protections consequences might apparent emulators need better hardware original setup use emulator media benefit owing primary use digital formats new media art relies heavily emulation preservation technique artwork artists cory arcangel specialise resurrecting outdated technology understand value decentralised deinstitutionalized mechanism digital culture preservation certain ways purpose new media art emulation maintain digital format stored forever replicated without mistake hardware ages becomes redundant reliant paradox also associated important emulation simulator must work future computers systems design future during design implementation new technologies emulation techniques widely used even system actually designed eases development process ability identify restore fix design flaws most emulators simply imitate hardware architecture must also supported operating system firmware software needed desired software may emulated any hardware must also provided virtual form apart interpreter language emulated binary machine example writing particular memory location could affect shown computer need emulated embedded machine software developers video game consoles often build software particularly precise emulators called simulators test actual hardware simulator actually developed several instances company supplying hardware theoretically improves accuracy math coprocessor installed present cpu render decided interrupt coprocessor available cpu executes coprocessor instructions calling routines math emulator emulator structure emulator usually divided modules correspond loosely subsystems emulated computer important parts memory unit used store applications cpu emulator cpu simulator inputoutput
