applications we run applications computer different one microsoft developed marketed sql server relational database management system rdbms primarily compete mysql oracle databases also called ms sql server ordbms platformdependent work gui commandbased software key interface tool sql server sql server management studio ssms operates bit bit environments want understand sql server completely must first learn sql language sql query processing language used dealing data relational databases according clientserver model database server computer program provides several services database programs computers result referred sql server database server uses sql query language microsoft sql server comes several versions corresponding various workloads demands data center edition optimized higher application support scalability levels express edition free scaleddown version software usage sql server following key usage ms sql server its main purpose build maintain databases used analyze data using sql server analysis services ssas used generate reports using sql server reporting services ssrs used perform etl operations using sql server integration services ssis version history sql server sql servers journey began june th microsoft joined ashtontate sybase develop new variant sybase sql server ibm os released first database product named sql server v first version served microsofts entry enterpriselevel database market competing mysql sybase ibm oracle databases microsoft retained ownership name sql server partnership ended early s microsoft released several sql server versions since s sql server early versions ms sql server primarily used departmental workgroup applications later microsoft expanded capabilities subsequent ones enterpriseclass relational dbms over years sql server integrated numerous data processing data analytics tools features support emerging technologies internet cloud computing mobile devices sql server editions sql server comprises five editions different bundled services tools pricing options meet user needs microsoft provides two editions sql server free charge given sql server developer edition released mainly use nonproduction environment ie database development testing allows build test demo purpose sql server express used smallscale applications databases disc storage capacities gb commercial purposes following editions used sql server enterprise used highend larger critical businesses all sql server features highend security advanced analytics machine learning included version sql server standard edition suitable data marts midtier applications included basic reporting analytics supports partial enterprise editions feature well server limitations number processor cores memory configure sql server web edition suitable web hosters want low overall ownership cost features scalability manageability capabilities affordability small largescale web properties sql server clientserver architecture sql server based clientserver architecture intended endusers known clients send requests ms sql server installed particular computer server give desired output soon processing input data requested server available separate program responsible handling database instructions statements commands sql server database engine controls data storage processing security thus core component ms sql server sql server architecture diagram explains basic overview sql server architecture sql server works clientserver architecture looks simple front end internally multiple processes run background fulfill request based architecture sql server mainly three major components network protocols sni sql server network interface database engine sqlos network protocol entirely responsible sql server database engines client connectivity client connectivity sql server database engine also one protocol named via via hardwarebased protocol obsolete microsoft latest sql server configuration manager see protocol supports three primary protocols network connectivity shared memory simplest protocol require configuration works system sql server installed communication client server tcpip commonly used clientserver communication protocol we use sql server configuration manager enable named pipes mainly used lan connectivity enabled sql server configuration manager database engine core sql server architecture second layer architecture provides connectivity user connections using network protocol sql server operating system perform actual execution shows logical architectures database objects tables views stored procedures triggers work physical architecture relation engine fulfill client requests database engine consists two parts relational engine responsible evaluating user requests performs execution decides efficient way run query also named query processor query processing memory management thread task management buffer management distributed query processing main tasks performed engine storage engine shows physical database architecture well data storage retrieval storage systems buffer manager sql os first used sql previously considered small medium applications microsoft upgrades sql server sql accommodate highend enterprise database load its layer lies database engine windows operating system many operating system services handled sqlos including memory io management scheduling threading exception handling synchronization sql server services tools both data management business intelligence bi tools services included ms sql server let us discuss sql server includes following tools services data management sql server integration services ssis tool transfers various data types one source another export import transformation loading converts raw data information used future sql server data quality services dqs creates knowledgebased data quality product employs perform data correction enrichment standardization deduplication we also use cleanse data cloudbased reference data services sql server master data services mds used manage master set organizations data organizes data models create rules data updation control updates data sql server data tool ssdt database design development tool sql server management studio ssms tool allows us manage deploy monitor sql server databases sql server includes following tools services data analysis sql server analysis services ssas tool used decision support business analytics analytical data engine designed deeper faster data analysis data mining also machine learning capabilities r python language integrated sql server advanced analytics sql server reporting services ssrs decisionmaking capability well set tools services creating deploying managing reports hadoop integrated tool sql server also following essential components sql server enables us starts stops pauses continues ms sql server instance sql server agent works task scheduler computer system we use whenever need sql server browser receives users request connects appropriate sql server instance sql server fulltext search fulltext search searches document keywords may may exactly match search criteria enables user run fulltext queries character data tables sql server vss writer used sql server running backup restore data files sql server instances instance installation sql server we install several instances particular machine one default exact copy server files databases security credentials sql server divided two types primary instances we access primary instance two ways first using server name second ip address always unique named instances we access appending backslash instance name example suppose want connect instance named xxx local server need use xxx server running sql server later run instances time advantages sql server instances following advantages sql server instance installation different versions one machine allows us install multiple versions single computer operates independently others cost reduction helps reducing operating costs sql server we get different services different instances dont buy single license anything maintain production development test environments separately key advantage running multiple versions sql server single computer distinguish development output test environments separately reduce temporary database problems run services single sql server instance high risk problems we avoid issues run different instances separate security privileges when different sql server instances run different services easy concentrate securing instance runs sensitive service maintain standby server sql server instance fails result service outage explains importance backup server available take event primary server fails feature makes simple accomplish sql server
