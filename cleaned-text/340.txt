james gosling sun microsystems multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types transformer transformer one oldest innovations electrical electronics field widely used device almost every electrical network circuitry general people know transformers huge heavy objects typically found corners streets causing random buzz noises often spitting sparks however type transformer we reclaiming benefits transformers many electrical devices whether realize even phone laptop charger small transformer entirely different mechanism various transformers used electrical power systems various purposes electrical power generation distribution transmission utilization article discussing major types before discussing types transformers let us first briefly discuss definition transformer what transformer transformer primarily refers devices designed transmission electrical energy required voltage levels transmission current usually alternating current ac transformer mainly used circuits need increase decrease supply voltage without changing current frequency words transformer usually voltage control device designed primarily transmit distribute alternating current transformers mainly operate two principles mutual induction electromagnetic induction transformers idea first introduced michael faraday later adopted former scientists scholars main purpose designing transformers establish balance power generated high voltages consumption low voltages target devices components transformer when comes construction knowledge transformers basic components essential major components transformer mainly include bobbin core windings insulation agents bobbin bobbin fundamental part transformer mainly provides spool allows us wind windings around also helps holding core fixed position typically composed using heatresistant plastic material furthermore metal pins used solder windingsends need mounting pcb core core another essential part transformer comes different shapes sizes depending requirements primarily provides support winding wrapped transformer additionally core helps achieve low reluctance path magnetic flux flow magnetic properties core define electrical properties transformer core composition usually determines factors operating voltage power current etc windings windings refer set wires wrapped transformer cores generally wire used

electric energy consumption transmission therefore different transformers based different categories type unique structure construction method functions applications however types broadly classified based following categories based voltage levels based mediums used cores based winding arrangements based usage let us understand type detail classification transformer based voltage levels transformers designed multiple types construction one construction method includes coils primary sides voltage level converted secondary side transformers typically electrical connection sides independent coils conduct electricity electromagnetic flux based voltage range transformers mainly divided following three types stepdown transformer stepdown transformers mainly used convert primary voltage levels lower voltages across secondary coil reason called stepdown transformers conversion voltages made possible changing number windings coils total number windings stepdown transformers

secondary side higher primary side transformers mainly used applications low voltage changed relatively higher voltagefor example inverters stabilizers etc isolation transformer isolation transformers neither increase decrease voltages primary side secondary side voltage remains sides isolation transformers number windings primary secondary sides also transformers help isolate voltages more specifically help canceling noise transfer primary side secondary side besides also used safety reasons classification transformer based medium used cores transformers mainly transmit energy primary

efficient way enhanced electrical performance furthermore also provides high inductance leakage inductance low apart windings relatively short also decreases transformers overall weight aircore transformer name suggests air core transforms physical magnetic core flux linkage occurs completely air transformers windings primary secondary wrapped nonmagnetic strip alternating current given primary coil generates electromagnetic field around later secondary coil comes inside magnetic field therefore secondary coil induced magnetic field later helps power load air core transformers work
