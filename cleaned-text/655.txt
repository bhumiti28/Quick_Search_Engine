what gene types genes genetic code codon protein synthesis next prev golgi body golgi apparatus golgi complex cell organelle golgi body one important cell organelles also known golgi apparatus golgi complex golgi body discovered camillo gogi cells cats barn owl however ultrastructure given dalton sometimes also known daltons complex also called lipochondria besides plant cells known dictyosome found eukaryotic cells except mature mammalian red blood cells rbcs also absent prokaryotic cells prokaryotes lack membranebound cell organelles size golgi body its size varies according functions cells example bigger secretory cells cells secretory function liver cells secrete various secretions nonsecretory cells comparatively smaller size muscle cells number golgi body one golgi body per cell animal cells however plant cells number golgi bodies fixed varies cell cell eg golgi bodies plant cell plant cell secretory functions animals vertebrates golgi body perinuclear close nucleus whereas invertebrates plant cells scattered cytoplasm furthermore also clear cytoplasmic region around cell organelle called zone exclusion contain organelle furthermore golgi body pleomorphic organelle means change shape per functions performed structure golgi body made stacks membranebound flattened sacs called cisternae vesicles vacuoles two faces cis face receiving face receives proteins lipids trans face supplying face supplies modified processed proteins different destinations its main parts described cisternae flattened sac like structures straight slightly curved ends swollen swollen ends known golgian vacuoles thickness cisterna ranges nm gap two adjacent cisternae around nm number cisternae present golgi body also variable number animal cells plant cells however fungi one cisterna fungi also called unicisternal golgi body cisternae cis region differ cisternae trans region shape size enzymatic activity content vesicles cisternae cis region face towards rough er whereas cisternae trans region face towards plasma membrane cisternae located cis trans regions called medial cisterns cis face cisternae medial cisternae trans face cisternae contain different enzymes required modify sort pack proteins transportation ii vesicles also spherical structures smaller vacuoles located towards convex side cis face golgi body iii vacuoles spherical structures diameter around angstrom usually found close concave side trans face golgi body besides golgi body shows polarity two sides one concave convex side concave side towards plasma membrane known trans face maturation face whereas convex side towards nuclear membrane known cis face formative face how golgi body works part membrane rough er buds forms transport vesicles transport protein golgi body transports vesicle travels towards cis face golgi body fuses cisterna cis face releases content proteins cisterna vesicles coming rer contain proteins vesicles coming ser contain lipids golgi body modifies protein lipid products modification occurs middle cisternae modified proteins move one cisterna adjacent cisterna transfer vesicle buds swollen edge golgian vacuole cisterna golgian vacuole increases size buds form vesicles containing final modified product vesicles may contain hydrolytic enzymes case called lysosomes modified products vesicles reach destinations organelles cytosol outside cells vesicles like small bubbles transport proteins er ga ga destinations generated membrane er ga budding when vesicles reach destination membrane fused release protein cargos so entry cis face receives proteins er modifies proteins medial region sugar added proteins lipids form glycoproteins glycolipids respectively exit trans face final processing proteins occur involves sorting packaging transport proteins destination vesicles some processed proteins transferred secretory vesicles trans face plasma membrane discharged extracellular fluid exocytosis whereas processed proteins transferred plasma membrane vesicles integrate used plasma membrane some proteins leave trans face storage vesicles lysosome so say lysosome formed golgi body besides golgi body tags proteins sugar molecules work shipping label protein molecules so main job modification packaging transport proteins synthesis plasma membrane lysosomes cytochemistry golgi body golgi body contains lipids shows affinity silver osmium stains its membrane made equal parts proteins lipids also contains carbohydrates concentration gradient polysaccharide also found across organelle higher concentration maturating trans face low concentration formative cis face besides also contains fatty acids vitamin c carotenoids various enzymes phosphatase glycosyltransferase mannosidases phospholipases oxidoreductases transferases kinases origin golgi body many theories origin golgi body however per electron microscopic studies found vesicles arise outer nuclear membrane er form golgi body vesicles called transition vesicles may form golgi complex may fuse existing cisterna membrane present cytoplasm functions golgi complex receives proteins lipids er carry processing modifies proteins lipids perform packaging transportation final products vesicles example goblet cells secrete polysaccharides secretion collagen protein connective tissue etc performs glycosylation process carbohydrate added proteins lipids glycoprotein formed carbohydrate added protein golgi body similarly glycolipids formed adding carbohydrate lipid also forms acrosome sperm head secretes enzyme sperm lysins helps dissolve outer layers egg fertilization could occur helps formation primary lysosomes also called direction macromolecular transportation cells helps movement macromolecules alters carbohydrate part glycoproteins adding removing modifying carbohydrates also processes lipids adding phosphate groups glycoproteins lipids thus makes phospholipids cell membrane transports proteins different parts cell endocrine cells helps secretion hormones performs vitellogenesis yolk formation eggs also helps cell plate formation imports sugars cytosol perform glycosylation phosphorylation processes breaks proteins forms small active fragments site sulfate groups added protein molecules plants takes part discharge materials primary secondary cell walls example formation export glycoproteins pectins lipids complex polysaccharides cell wall plant cells also synthesised golgi apparatus sacs golgi bodies serve chambers various cellular reactions also forms lysosomes so say main function ga secretory produces secretory vesicles vacuoles contain secretions cells like proteins enzymes etc besides also takes part formation cell wall plasma membrane lysosomes next topicmitochondria prev next videos
