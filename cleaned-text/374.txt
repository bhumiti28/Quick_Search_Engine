difference ddl dml database list related records database management system common way manage databases dbms sql structured query language commands needed interact database systems sql commands used build tables insert data tables remove drop tables change tables set permissions users we categorize sql commands ddl dql dcl dml article explains complete overview ddl dml languages difference ddl dml commands common part interview question key distinction ddl command used create database schema dml command used modify tables existing data before making comparison first know sql commands what ddl command ddl stands data definition language name suggests ddl commands help define structure databases schema when execute ddl statements takes effect immediately changes made database using command saved permanently commands autocommitted following commands come ddl language create used create new database objects table views function stored procedure triggers etc drop used delete database objects including structures server permanently alter its used update database structure modifying characteristics existing attribute adding new attributes truncate used completely remove data table including structure space allocates server rename command renames content database why use ddl commands following reasons use ddl commands allows us store shared data database improved integrity due data independence feature enable multiple users work databases improved security efficient data access what dml command stands data manipulation language dml commands deal manipulation existing records database responsible changes occur database changes made database using command cant save permanently commands autocommitted therefore changes rollback following commands come dml language select command used extract information table insert sql query allows us add data tables row update command used alter modify contents table delete command used delete records database table either individually groups why use dml commands following reasons use dml commands helps users change data database table helps users specify data needed facilitates human interaction system key differences ddl dml commands following points explain main differences ddl dml commands data definition language ddl statements describe structure database schema data manipulation language dml statements hand allow altering data already exists database we use ddl commands creating database schema dml commands used populate manipulate database ddl commands affect whole database table whereas dml statements affect single multiple rows based condition specified query since ddl commands autocommitted modifications permanent cannot reversed dml statements hand autocommitted means modifications permanent reversed dml imperative procedural method whereas ddl declarative method data dml statements filtered where clause records ddl statements cannot filtered where clause ddl vs dml comparison chart following comparison chart explains main differences quick manner comparison basis ddl dml basic helps us define databases structure schema deals data stored database allows us manipulate ie retrieve update delete data stored database fullform full form ddl data definition language full form dml data manipulation language categorization ddl commands classification dml commands classified procedural nonprocedural declarative dmls command uses commonly used commands ddl language create drop alter truncate rename commonly used commands dml language insert update delete select autocommit ddl commands autocommitted changes happen database permanent dml commands autocommitted database changes permanent rollback ddl commands made changes permanent therefore cannot roll back statements dml commands make changes permanent therefore rollback possible statements where clause ddl commands use where clause filtration records possible dml statements use where clause manipulating data database effect ddl command affects entire database table dml commands affect single multiple records based specified condition conclusion article made comparison ddl dml commands here concluded forming database languages necessary form access database when handle extensive database make sure mentioned condition properly delete entire database table next
