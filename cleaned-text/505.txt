multiprogramming vs multiprocessing vs multitasking next prev types coal when comes fuel coal considered essential source general coal one nonrenewable sources energy earth typically takes millions years form however different types important select appropriate type coal various purposes article discussing different types coal including definitions characteristics before discussing various coal types let us first briefly understand definition coal formation process what coal coal refers combustible black dark brownishblack sedimentary rock containing relatively high amounts carbon hydrocarbons words coal refers solid carbonrich material black brown often occurs stratified sedimentary deposits also known black gold coal one essential types fossil fuels usually takes millions years form besides coal sorted nonrenewable energy resource exhaustible natural resource coal produced limited quantities how coal formed coal believed formed millions years ago believed mainly earth covered vast moist forests trees shrubs herbs ferns etc all plants completed life cycle fell surface earth most later deposited water part natural processes new plants evolved replaced old ones entire cycle repeated many years earths surface kept changing overlapping forming many layers different elements compositions since many thick layers dead decomposed material lying beneath earths surface withstand varying amounts heat pressure eventually led changes chemical physical properties layer due constant change properties oxygen content extracted plant layers led accumulation rich carbon after long time deposited plants layers converted coal despite carbon many elements found coal hydrogen nitrogen sulfur ash etc types coal coal usually consists different elements carbon volatile matter moisture ash etc amounts carbon coal play vital role determining coals overall quality besides coal also undergoes different physical chemical changes due different amounts heat pressure based composition elements certain property changes classified different types particular coal divided following types lignite coal subbituminous coal bituminous coal anthracite coal four types also divided lowrank coals lignite subbituminous hard coals bituminous anthracite based presence carbon content generally high carbon content found coals spent time formation lower carbon content found younger coals spent less time formation let us discuss type detail lignite lignite also called brown coal considered youngest form coal usually brown kind youngest fossil fuel formed million years formation period relatively short compared coal types type coal usually consists carbon deposits compounds mercury sulfur etc since lignite coal young form coal lowest heating value relatively high moisture content result amount carbon lignite low lignite coal best known power electricity generation believed worlds coal reserves subbituminous after millions years lignite continually treated extreme pressure temperature convert subbituminous subbituminous intermediate stage coal lies lignite bituminous type coal usually consists carbon deposits believed age approximately million years color coal type generally greyblack dark brown subbituminous also known black lignite subbituminous contains lowtomoderate heating values typically higher lignite lower bituminous type coal used many purposes power generation well industrial processes type coal believed part worlds coal reserves bituminous bituminous coal intermediate coal subbituminous anthracite type coal relatively much harder black compared lignite coal subbituminous coal amounts carbon deposits bituminous typically range percent percent bituminous coal one longest buried fossil fuels believed around million years old generally bituminous coal looks smooth shiny blocky structure however thin alternating shiny dull layers seen closer look bituminous coal contains higher heating value however lower anthracite moreover low moisture content type coal believed part worlds coal reserves bituminous subdivided thermal metallurgical thermal coal mainly used electricity generation producing cement several industrial purposes metallurgical coal mainly used manufacture iron steel anthracite anthracite far considered highest quality coal carbon deposits amount carbon deposits coal higher coal types hard dark black coal often termed hard coal anthracite oldest type coal believed approximately million years old due long burial time anthracite exhibits comparatively high energy density eventually makes anthracite heat quickly become hot burning anthracite coal contains highest amounts heating value lowest moisture content when burnt anthracite reach high temperatures type coal believed part worlds coal reserves comparatively small portion overall coal available market anthracite mainly used space heating produce much smoke furthermore considered ideal smokeless fuel many applications domestic industrial purposes coal ranks coal rank refers stages involved slow natural process called coalification process mainly involves stages matter properties buried plants change harder drier carbonrich material particular rank typically determined type vegetation coal originated coals depth burial amount pressure temperature depth time taken coal form factors primarily responsible determining degree transformation original plant material carbon specifically amount carbon deposits main factor decides coals rank following image displays transformation plant material coal based coal ranks shown image plant material first turns peat precursor coal soft organic structure partially decayed plants mineral water when peat passed continuously extreme pressures temperatures undergoes many physical chemical changes eventually converts peat various forms coal accordingly generally peat first converted lignite subbituminous bituminous anthracite next topictypes plants prev next videos join our
