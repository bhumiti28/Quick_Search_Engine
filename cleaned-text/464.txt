tree avl tree analysis algorithms set asymptotic analysis difficulty level basic last updated nov why performance analysis many important things taken care like user friendliness modularity security maintainability etc why worry performance answer simple things performance so performance like currency buy things another reason studying performance speed fun summarize performance scale imagine text editor load pages spell check page per minute image editor takes hour rotate image degrees left get software feature cope scale tasks users need perform good dead given two algorithms task find one better one naive way implement algorithms run two programs computer different inputs see one takes less time many problems approach analysis algorithms might possible inputs first algorithm performs better second inputs second performs better might also possible inputs first algorithm perform better one machine second works better machine inputs asymptotic analysis big idea handles issues analyzing algorithms asymptotic analysis evaluate performance algorithm terms input size dont measure actual running time we calculate time space taken algorithm increases input size example let us consider search problem searching given item sorted array one way search linear search order growth linear way binary search order growth logarithmic understand asymptotic analysis solves mentioned problems analyzing algorithms let us say run linear search fast computer binary search slow computer b pick constant values two computers tells us exactly long takes given machine perform search seconds lets say constant constant b means times powerful b small values input array size n fast computer may take less time certain value input array size binary search definitely start taking less time compared linear search even though binary search run slow machine reason order growth binary search respect input size logarithmic order growth linear search linear so machine dependent constants always ignored certain value input size here running times example linear search running time seconds n binary search running time seconds b logn
