types reinforcement learning reinforcement learning algorithm markov decision process what qlearning difference supervised learning reinforcement learning applications reinforcement learning conclusion what reinforcement learning reinforcement learning feedbackbased machine learning technique agent learns behave environment performing actions seeing results actions good action agent gets positive feedback bad action agent gets negative feedback penalty reinforcement learning agent learns automatically using feedbacks without labeled data unlike supervised learning since labeled data agent bound learn experience rl solves specific type problem decision making sequential goal longterm gameplaying robotics etc agent interacts environment explores primary goal agent reinforcement learning improve performance getting maximum positive rewards agent learns process hit trial based experience learns perform task better way hence say reinforcement learning type machine learning method intelligent agent computer program interacts environment learns act within how robotic dog learns movement arms example reinforcement learning core part artificial intelligence ai agent works concept reinforcement learning here need preprogram agent learns experience without human intervention example suppose ai agent present within maze environment goal find diamond agent interacts environment performing actions based actions state agent gets changed also receives reward penalty feedback agent continues three things take action change stateremain state get feedback actions learns explores environment agent learns actions lead positive feedback rewards actions lead negative feedback penalty positive reward agent gets positive point penalty gets negative point terms used reinforcement learning agent entity perceiveexplore environment act upon environment situation agent present surrounded rl assume stochastic environment means random nature action actions moves taken agent within environment state state situation returned environment action taken agent reward feedback returned agent environment evaluate action agent policy policy strategy applied agent next action based current state value expected longterm retuned discount factor opposite shortterm reward qvalue mostly similar value takes one additional parameter current action key features reinforcement learning rl agent instructed environment actions need taken based hit trial process agent takes next action changes states according feedback previous action agent may get delayed reward environment stochastic agent needs explore reach get maximum positive rewards approaches implement reinforcement learning mainly three ways implement reinforcementlearning ml valuebased valuebased approach find optimal value function maximum value state policy therefore agent expects longterm return states policy policybased policybased approach find optimal policy maximum future rewards without using value function approach agent tries apply policy action performed step helps maximize future reward policybased approach mainly two types policy deterministic action produced policy state stochastic policy probability determines produced action modelbased modelbased approach virtual model created environment agent explores environment learn particular solution algorithm approach model representation different environment elements reinforcement learning four main elements reinforcement learning given policy reward signal value function model environment policy policy defined way agent behaves given time maps perceived states environment actions taken states policy core element rl alone define behavior agent cases may simple function lookup table whereas cases may involve general computation search process could deterministic stochastic policy deterministic policy stochastic policy pat st reward signal goal reinforcement learning defined reward signal state environment sends immediate signal learning agent signal known reward signal rewards given according good bad actions taken agent agents main objective maximize total number rewards good actions reward signal change policy action selected agent leads low reward policy may change select actions future value function value function gives information good situation action much reward agent expect reward indicates immediate signal good bad action whereas value function specifies good state action future value function depends reward without reward could value goal estimating values achieve rewards model last element reinforcement learning model mimics behavior environment help model one make inferences environment behave state action given model predict next state reward model used planning means provides way take course action considering future situations actually experiencing situations approaches solving rl problems help model termed modelbased approach comparatively approach without using model called modelfree approach how reinforcement learning work understand working process rl need consider two main things environment anything room maze football ground etc agent intelligent agent ai robot lets take example maze environment agent needs explore consider image image agent first block maze maze consisting s block wall s fire pit s diamond block agent cannot cross s block solid wall agent reaches s block get reward reaches fire pit gets reward point take four actions move move move left move right agent take path reach final point needs make possible fewer steps suppose agent considers path s s s s s get reward point agent try remember preceding steps taken reach final step memorize steps assigns value previous step consider step now agent successfully stored previous steps assigning value previous block agent starts moving block value block sides consider diagram difficult condition agent whether go block value so approach suitable agent reach destination hence solve problem use bellman equation main concept behind reinforcement learning bellman equation bellman equation introduced mathematician richard ernest bellman year hence called bellman equation associated dynamic programming used calculate values decision problem certain point including values previous states way calculating value functions dynamic programming environment leads modern
