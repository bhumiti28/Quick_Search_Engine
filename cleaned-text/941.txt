various algorithms techniques tutorial describes rich visual experience provided user explaining processed computer introduction computer graphics computer graphics involves technology access process transforms presents information visual form role computer graphics insensible today life computer graphics become common element user interfaces tv commercial motion pictures computer graphics creation pictures help computer end product computer graphics picture may business graph drawing engineering computer graphics two threedimensional pictures created used research many hardware devices algorithm developing improving speed picture generation passes time includes creation storage models image objects models various fields like engineering mathematical today computer graphics entirely different earlier one possible interactive user control structure object various input devices definition computer graphics use computers create manipulate pictures display device comprises software techniques create store modify represents pictures why computer graphics used suppose shoe manufacturing company want show sale shoes five years vast amount information store so lot time memory needed method tough understand common man situation graphics better alternative graphics tools charts graphs using graphs data represented pictorial form picture understood easily single look interactive
