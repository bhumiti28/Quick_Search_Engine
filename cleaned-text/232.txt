ios app we used sqlite coredata persist data ios applications realm alternative apples coredata faster easier use coredata sqlite free charge unlimited use take advantage realms cloud features tutorial create new ios project use realm store data we discuss basic crud create read update delete operations database what realm realm database built target mobile applications ios android works better faster sqlite coredata ios applications its easier use requires less code store retrieve data free use ios android apps without limits realm alternative mobile databases currently dont many options sqlite wrapper works top sqlite coredata mainly designed easy use orm uses persistence engine provide speed performance why use realm realm superior mobile databases terms speed easier use also requires less code retrieve store data section tutorial discuss advantages disadvantages realm database easy install ios simple install realm applications we easily install realm ios applications using cocoapods works faster databases faster save retrieve performing database operations realm realm works faster sqlite coredata ios applications crossplatform realm database crossplatform therefore easily work ios android regardless technology working upon scalability important consider databases scalability developing applications deal large number users records we use realm deal huge amount data lesser time we also get speed smoothness using realm application good documentation support realm team provides rich documentation installing using realm database applications free realm free benefits provided concepts overview understand proper functioning realm database need know classes going use tutorial realm realm instances basic building block framework works access point underlying database like core data managed object context instances created using realm initializer object realm model we need create model define database schema create model need subclass object define fields want persist properties relationships create onetomany relationships objects declaring property objects type want refer we create manytoone manytomany relationships via property type list write transactions any operations database like creating editing deleting objects must performed within writes calling write realm instances queries retrieve objects database use queries simplest form query calling objects realm instance passing class object youre looking data retrieval needs complex use predicates chain queries order results results results autoupdating container type get back object queries many similarities regular arrays including subscript syntax getting started first need create new xcode project create singleview ios application swift shown tutorial add realm database project use cocoapods purpose open terminal navigate project directory run following command
