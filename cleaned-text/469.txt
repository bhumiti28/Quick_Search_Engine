training data science tutorial data science tutorial data science tutorial beginners data science become demanding job st century every organization looking candidates knowledge data science tutorial giving introduction data science data science job roles tools data science components data science application etc so lets start what data science data science deep study massive amount data involves extracting meaningful insights raw structured unstructured data processed using scientific method different technologies algorithms multidisciplinary field uses tools techniques manipulate data find something new meaningful data science uses powerful hardware programming systems efficient algorithms solve data related problems future artificial intelligence short say data science asking correct questions analyzing raw data modeling data using various complex efficient algorithms visualizing data get better perspective understanding data make better decisions finding final result example let suppose want travel station station b car now need take decisions route best route reach faster location route traffic jam costeffective all decision factors act input data get appropriate answer decisions analysis data called data analysis part data science need data science some years ago data less mostly available structured form could easily stored excel sheets processed using bi tools todays world data becoming vast ie approximately quintals bytes data generating every day led data explosion estimated per researches mb data created every single second single person earth every company requires data work grow improve businesses now handling huge amount data challenging task every organization so handle process analysis required complex powerful efficient algorithms technology technology came existence data science following main reasons using data science technology help data science technology convert massive amount raw unstructured data meaningful insights data science technology opting various companies whether big brand startup google amazon netflix etc handle huge amount data using data science algorithms better customer experience data science working automating transportation creating selfdriving car future transportation data science help different predictions various survey elections flight ticket confirmation etc data science jobs per various surveys data scientist job becoming demanding job st century due increasing demands data science some people also called hottest job title st century data scientists experts use various statistical tools machine learning algorithms understand analyze data average salary range data scientist approximately per annum per different researches millions job created year types data science job learn data science get opportunity find various exciting job roles domain main job roles given data scientist data analyst machine learning expert data engineer data architect data administrator business analyst business intelligence manager below explanation critical job titles data science data analyst data analyst individual performs mining huge amount data models data looks patterns relationship trends end day comes visualization reporting analyzing data decision making problemsolving process skill required becoming data analyst must get good background mathematics business

deployment various tools techniques methodologies algorithms etc skill required become data scientist one technical language skills r sas sql python hive pig apache spark matlab data scientists must understanding statistics mathematics visualization communication skills prerequisite data science nontechnical prerequisite curiosity learn data science one must curiosities when curiosity ask various questions understand business problem easily critical thinking also required data scientist find multiple new ways solve problem efficiency communication skills communication skills important data scientist solving business problem need communicate team technical prerequisite machine learning understand data science one needs understand concept machine learning data science uses machine learning algorithms solve various problems mathematical modeling mathematical modeling required make fast mathematical calculations predictions available data statistics basic understanding statistics required mean median standard deviation needed extract knowledge obtain better results data computer programming data science knowledge least one programming language required r python spark required computer programming languages data science databases depth understanding databases sql essential data science get data work data difference bi data science bi stands business intelligence also used data analysis business information below differences bi data sciences criterion business intelligence data science data source business intelligence deals structured data eg data warehouse data science deals structured unstructured data eg weblogs feedback etc method analyticalhistorical data scientificgoes deeper know reason data report skills statistics visualization two skills required business intelligence statistics visualization machine learning required skills data science focus business intelligence focuses past present data data science focuses past data present data also future predictions data science components main components data science given statistics statistics one important components data science statistics way collect analyze numerical data large amount finding meaningful insights domain expertise data science domain expertise binds data science together domain expertise means specialized knowledge skills particular area data science various areas need domain experts data engineering data engineering part data science involves acquiring storing retrieving transforming data data engineering also includes metadata data data data visualization data visualization meant representing data visual context people easily understand significance data data visualization makes easy access huge amount data visuals advanced computing heavy lifting data science advanced computing advanced computing involves designing writing debugging maintaining source code computer programs mathematics mathematics critical part data science mathematics involves study quantity structure space changes data scientist knowledge good mathematics essential machine learning machine learning backbone data science machine learning provide training machine act human brain data science use various machine learning algorithms solve problems tools data science following tools required data science data analysis tools r python statistics sas jupyter r studio matlab
