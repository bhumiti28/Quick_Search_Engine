tutorial spring cloud spring cloud tutorial spring microservices spring microservices tutorial interview questions spring interview next spring boot tutorial spring boot tutorial provides basic advanced concepts spring framework our spring boot tutorial designed beginners professionals spring boot spring module provides rad rapid application development feature spring framework our spring boot tutorial includes topics spring boot features project maven project starter project wizard spring initializr cli applications annotations dependency management properties starters actuator jpa jdbc etc what spring boot spring boot project built top spring framework provides easier faster way set configure run simple webbased applications spring module provides rad rapid application development feature spring framework used create standalone springbased application run needs minimal spring configuration short spring boot combination spring framework embedded servers spring boot requirement xml configuration deployment descriptor uses convention configuration software design paradigm means decreases effort developer we use spring sts ide spring initializr develop spring boot java applications why use spring boot framework we use spring boot framework dependency injection approach used spring boot contains powerful database transaction management capabilities simplifies integration java frameworks like jpahibernate orm struts etc reduces cost development time application along spring boot framework many spring sister projects help build applications addressing modern business needs following spring sister projects follows spring data simplifies data access relational nosql databases spring batch provides powerful batch processing spring security security framework provides robust security applications spring social supports integration social networking like linkedin spring integration implementation enterprise integration patterns facilitates integration enterprise applications using lightweight messaging declarative adapters advantages spring boot creates standalone spring applications started using java jar tests web applications easily help different embedded http servers tomcat jetty etc we dont need deploy war files provides opinionated starter poms simplify maven configuration provides productionready features metrics health checks externalized configuration requirement xml configuration offers cli tool developing testing spring boot application offers number plugins also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes code included many places little alteration xml configuration annotations increases productivity reduces development time limitations spring boot spring boot use dependencies going used application dependencies increase size application goals spring boot main goal spring boot reduce development unit test integration test time provides opinionated development approach avoids defining annotation configuration avoids writing lots import statements avoids xml configuration providing avoiding points spring boot framework reduces development time developer effort increases productivity prerequisite spring boot create spring boot application following prerequisites tutorial use spring tool suite sts ide java maven spring framework buildsnapshot ide spring tool suite recommended spring boot features web development springapplication application events listeners admin features externalized configuration properties files yaml support typesafe configuration logging security web development wellsuited spring module web application development we easily create selfcontained http application uses embedded servers like tomcat jetty undertow we use springbootstarterweb module start run application quickly springapplication springapplication class provides convenient way bootstrap spring application started main method we call application calling static run method
