testing interview next prev positive testing software testing procedure validating confirming software application test whether application working per given requirement primary purpose performing type software testing identify bugs help endusers correct hisher mistakes inserting incorrect data handling categorizes rectify software testing process helps us enhance product quality robustness deliver userfriendly application achieve aspects use different testing types test techniques here discussing one namely positive testing article going discuss following topics related positive testing what positive testing objective why need perform positive testing how perform positive testing example positive testing benefits positive testing what positive testing another essential testing technique used show software product application test validates application performs positive set data type testing enter valid data set input value we implement positive testing validate exact working different software modules lines estimated performance response valid data input example suppose software applications like website mobile application needs objects like text boxes text forms so cases positive testing used tests specific functionality objects usually positive testing implemented make sure particular application software product meets clients specifications prospects words state positive testing mainly used help test engineer check whether software working expected using positive inputs concisely positive testing used test software application precisely meant perform note positive testing evaluates positive scenarios like happy paths valid data why need perform positive testing positive testing required perform may face following situations whenever application ready testing process test engineer implement scenarios designed functionality like database testing negative testing positive testing approved execution positive testing required time build ready known smoke testing build verification testingsanity testing first step test execution process examples positive testing better understanding positive testing see examples example example suppose one textbox accept alphabetic character values therefore case positive test scenario follows positive test scenario enter alphabetical character valuesand verify application receives input values test lets see one example positive testing example example suppose one web application need fill login form specific login page following condition needs considered user enter username password click submit button after inserting exact username password click submit button user navigated next page so case positive test scenario discussed positive test scenario insert right username password like username password click submit button check user navigated next page expected how execute positive testing order execute positive testing following two testing approaches highly recommended commonly used execution positive testing equivalence partitioning boundary value analysis both testing techniques mainly used design test case approaches relevant whenever test engineer needs test numeric fields test engineer check input data testing activities output executing positive testing because time test engineer needs analysis test input within limits given test data let us see details working equivalence partitioning boundary value analysis testing techniques one one equivalence partitioning one commonly used test case design techniques software testing equivalence partitioning input data separated partitions valid invalid values derived requirements specifications software product words say test engineer divide test input equal partitions use values section test data equivalence partitioning approach test engineer also needs ensure test data include values partitions let see one sample example better understanding example suppose one field system input value considered range values equivalence partitioning testing technique input data divided two two partitions see first partitionvalid second partitionvalid third partitioninvalid boundary value analysis another essentially used test case design technique boundary value analysis technique used test boundary values input values near boundary greater chances error mistake mainly used test numeric fields test engineer needs develop test data within boundaries data range boundary value analysis technique because input data selected outside boundary value limits while performing positive testing input range values b design test inputs values b b b let us take example better clarification example suppose system accept numbers numeric values rest numbers invalid values under boundary value analysis technique boundary values tested range advantages positive testing some significant benefits positive testing discussed used saves test engineers efforts finding wrong build initial stages test positive path application execute positive testing positive testing promise quality application test engineer cannot test applications performance unpredicted conditions user enters incorrect data overview article seen indetail information positive testing like needs positive testing execution process positive testing examples benefits positive testing after seeing mentation topics conclude positive testing necessary positive testing plays essential role verifying regular performance basic objects identified websites effective testing results need perform positive negative testing
