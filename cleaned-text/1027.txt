overview reproduction types definitions what reproduction reproduction defined process parent organism produces offspring biologically genetically similar reproduction refers process reproducing biological mechanism organism reproduces biologically equivalent offspring reproduction ensures continuation organism generation generation key attribute life earth although reproduction plants animals often thought terms production offspring important living organisms broader significance types reproduction mainly two types reproduction asexual reproduction sexual reproduction asexual reproduction asexual reproduction refers form reproduction one organism creates new individual asexual reproduction also doesnt require fusion gametes therefore offspring genetically similar parents species created asexual reproduction less diverse type unicellular organisms commonly practice method reproduction parent reproduces following means binary fission when cell divides two halves grows adult quickly like amoeba paramecium budding occurs organisms yeast division unequal little buds generated initially remain attached parent cell eventually separating maturing new yeast organisms fragmentation when parent body splits several fragments every fragment creates new entity seen spirogyra sporulation new organism develops spores form reproduction produced without fertilization distributed wind animals gemmule also asexual spores generated bryophytes animals sponges vegetative propagation plants flowering plants reproduce means reproduction asexual sexual asexual reproduction occurs plants vegetative elements roots stem leaves axillary buds within subject morphology flowering plants much detail already explored sexual reproduction sexual reproduction defined type reproduction involves generation offspring fusion male female gametes sexual reproduction male female gametes produced offspring gametes either made person different individuals opposite sex method typically slow complex compared asexual reproduction process organisms produced way genetically diverse thus along evolving climate conditions evolve people many multicellular species demonstrate sexual mode reproduction reproduction plants plants reproduce sexual asexual reproduction primary mode reproduction plants vegetative reproduction roots corm stem tubers rhizomes stolon undergo vegetative propagation plants sexual reproduction occurs pollination pollen grains anther male flower transferred stigma female flower without fertilization plants develop seeds process called apomixes here new seeds produced ovulum ovary reproduction animals animals sexual asexual reproduction sexual reproduction indicated fusion male female gametes method known fertilization fertilization may external internal mechanism male sperm fertilizes female egg outside body female external fertilization opposite fusion male female gametes happens within female body internal fertilization asexual reproduction requires processes reproduction including binary fission budding fragmentation etc reproductive systems species therefore development male female gametes occurs next
