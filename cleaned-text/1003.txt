transducer sensor transducer sensor similar related read given tutorial know basic difference transducer sensor what transducer transducer refers electronic device converts one form energy another form example loudspeaker lvdt thermocouple etc transducer main element plays vital role measuring instruments example consider example photoelectric cell converts sound energy electrical energy two types transducers active transducers passive transducers active transducers active transducers refer transducers need external source convert physical quantity electrical parameters example thermocouple solar panel passive transducers passive transducers refer transducers need external source convert physical quantity electrical quantity example lvdt thermistor applications transducers various application transducers transducers used sensor transducers used antennas transducers used ultrasound machines transducers used loudspeakers transducers used measuring instrument measure physical quantities like pressure speed force displacement toque etc what sensor sensor name suggests device senses something device made sense something words say sensor object whose motive detect changes environment provides corresponding output using electrical optical signals sensor transducer type responds input quantity like pressure speed pressure temperature etc generating output like voltage current let us understand concept sensor help example example proximity sensor good example sensor sensor mounted touch screen phone when talking someone cheek touches screen nothing happens proximity sensor detects holding phone close ear disables touch screen different sensors available markets detecting light motion temperature magnetic fields gravity humidity moisture vibration physical aspects external environment use different techniques detection purposes various types sensors motion sensors motion sensors designed detect respond movement happen outside component temperature sensors temperature sensors designed detect amount heat produced component optical sensors optical sensors designed detect presence light radiation sensors radiation sensors designed detect alpha beta gamma particles provide signal display devices proximity sensors proximity sensors designed detect presence nearby objects without contacting position sensors position sensors designed detect positions doors valves etc provide signals display devices applications sensors various application sensors automatic door automatic door uses infrared microwave radiation human body open close door mobile phones digital camera cameras using optical sensors capture images water level indicator temperature alarm humidity alarm optical alarm etc difference transducer sensor transducer sensor transducer refers device simply converts one form energy another form energy sensor object whose motive detect changes environment provides corresponding output using electrical optical signals transducers output electric output always sensor output always electric output all transducers sensors all sensors transducers converts change physical parameter useful energy form example piezoelectric crystal electrodes transducer sensor respond physical changes produce change physical parameter sensed transducer complicated sensor less complicated examples transducers loudspeaker lvdt thermocouple etc examples sensors capacitance temperature resistance etc next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please share learn latest
