group hold configurations select interrupt request set manual electrical switches may refer unit whole individual switch position changes operating mode device dip switches used place jumper blocks well help configure computer peripherals like motherboards hard drives sound cards modems primary function dip switch customize behavior electronic device modern times computers use plugandplay reason dip switches less common due use plug play computer manual configuration needed hardware normally auxiliary cards expansion cards motherboards include dip switches tiny rectangular components involved dip switches connecting mechanism parallel rows terminals circuit board need dip switches decreased due extra selfconfiguration hardware programmable chips computer through software control panel settings accessed make capable users convenient changes easily although multiple types two common slide rocker actuator dip switches spst contacts onoff switches spst stands singlepole singlethrow onebit binary value contained type dip switch standard ascii character additionally various pole throw configurations dip switches also found including single pole single throw spst type switch single terminal tofrom another one connected disconnected single toggle considered simplest type switch single pole double throw spdt two terminals one two terminals selected operator forced switch conditions like two terminals never connected eachother switch always connected one double pole double throw dpdt its function two separate spdt switches rotary dip switch various electrical contacts contained dip switch rotated aligned switch offer selection switching combinations small large size scenarios like ease adjustment user considered paramount space pbc especially limited rotary dip switches often seen particularly handy options widely used radio transmitters receivers test equipment precision measurement gauges aerospace measurement gauges military voicedata communications sound mixing editing precision also dip switches popular follows multiplethrow singlepole mtsp double pole double throw dpdt multiplepole singlethrow mpst double pole single throw spdt double pole single throw dpst how dip switches work small box housing dip switch small switch whose function offer range electrical inputs electronic device within line circle also referred set electrical switches organized line circle applications dip switches isa architecture pc expansion cards commonly used select irqs interrupt requests memory addresses s early s adverting cheaper use dip switches common arcade games enter game settings common applications dip switches garage door openers including early cordless phones widely used applications set security codes rolling code system used current garage door openers better security older computers able compatible video standards early video cards kinds switches played vital role terms facilitating compatibility video standards instance mda cga cards offered compatibility dip switches common consumers electronics even become less usable switches late s reasons become dip switches less common decreasing cos nonvolatile memory trend toward smaller products software menus however dip switches easy incorporate circuit designs also costly makes common use industrial equipment remote controls dip switches still used prevent interference some key points uses dip switches given dip switches comprise expansion modules modems video cards motherboards hard drives arcade game machines garage door openers mechanisms still commonly used pc expansion cards remote controls history dip switch earliest dip switch patent us patent pierre p schwab invented rotary style dip switch disclosed patent june schwabs patent application filed november patent granted dip switch granted us patent applied used atari flipper game pros cons dip switches without losing parts ability quickly change positions main advantages dip switches another option jumper blocks recently due increase easily customizable software configurations acceptance dip switches decreased however industrial equipment various functions widely use offers benefit easy incorporate circuit designs without system turned makes easy design circuit without need checking configurations where dip switches found device mainly dip switches found latest devices devices
