difference fragmentation regeneration difference fragmentation regeneration clear when organism splits separation happens fragmented parts organism evolve distinct individual organisms hand regeneration type asexual reproduction normal unicellular lower multicellular species like planar article discuss difference fragmentation regeneration firstly know fragmentation regeneration what fragmentation fragmentation refers process asexual reproduction parent organism splits multiple fragments fragment capable forming new organism distinction fragmentation regeneration unlike regeneration fragmentation splits entire organism parts green algae spirogyra floats water good example fragmentation also known splitting reproduction processes may seen various species like bacteria filamentous cyanobacteria lichens sponges flatworms etc what regeneration processes organism cut many parts part return original state process conducted specialized cells called stem cells occurs species basic structure specialized cells cells easily separated large number cells each cell changes shape different types cells tissues sequential change process defined development tissues formed different sections body organs main differences fragmentation regeneration following key differences fragmentation regeneration fragmentation may occur multicellular species bodys basic organization contrast regeneration may occur fully differentiated multicellular organism complex body organization fragmentation organism splits pieces piece evolves new entity whereas regeneration organisms divide parts parts may may grouped new body any specialized cells involved fragmentation contrast specialized cells proliferate form mass cells regeneration cells vary mass shape various types cells tissues headtohead comparison fragmentation regeneration chart discuss headtohead comparison fragmentation regeneration fragmentation regeneration during fragmentation process organism divides fragments fragments develops separate organism during regeneration organism regenerates particular part body damage body fragmentation process viewed organism simple body organization multicellular regeneration process view multicellular organism complex body organization any specialized cells involved fragmentation specialized cells proliferate make mass cells regeneration limited specified organism however regeneration view organisms either specified extent completely viewed invertebrates view vertebrates invertebrates reproduction process reproduction process regeneration lost body parts cells tissues usually view plants especially nonvascular ones usually viewed animals compared plants happens limited number organisms every organism may exhibit phenomenon regeneration conclusion fragmentation form asexual reproduction organism reproduces breaking parts part grows particular organism hand regeneration may occur organism regrows parts limbs damaged due predation next
