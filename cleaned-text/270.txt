concepts blockchain blockchain constantly growing ledger keeps permanent record transactions taken place secure chronological immutable way used secure transfer money property contracts etc without requiring thirdparty intermediary bank government blockchain software protocol could run without internet like smtp email what blockchain blockchain constantly growing ledger keeps permanent record transactions taken place secure chronological immutable way lets breakdown definition ledger file constantly growing permanent means transaction goes inside blockchain put permanently ledger secure blockchain placed information secure way uses advanced cryptography make sure information locked inside blockchain chronological chronological means every transaction happens previous one immutable means build transaction onto blockchain ledger never changed blockchain chain blocks contain information each block records recent transactions completed goes blockchain permanent database each time block gets completed new block generated note blockchain used secure transfer money property contracts etc without requiring thirdparty intermediary like bank government blockchain software protocol could run without internet like smtp used email who uses blockchain blockchain technology integrated multiple areas primary use blockchains distributed ledger cryptocurrencies shows great promise across wide range business applications like banking finance government healthcare insurance media entertainment retail etc need blockchain blockchain technology become popular following time reduction financial industry blockchain allow quicker settlement trades take lengthy process verification settlement clearance single version agreedupon data available stakeholders unchangeable transactions blockchain register transactions chronological order certifies unalterability operations means new block added chain ledgers cannot removed modified reliability blockchain certifies verifies identities interested parties removes double records reducing rates accelerates transactions security blockchain uses advanced cryptography make sure information locked inside blockchain uses distributed ledger technology party holds copy original chain system remains operative even large number nodes fall collaboration allows party transact directly without requiring thirdparty intermediary decentralized decentralized central authority supervising anything standards rules every node exchanges blockchain information method ensures transactions validated valid transactions
