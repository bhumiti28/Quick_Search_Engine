difference osmosis diffusion javatpoint home all differences differences medical differences science differences quiz projects interview q forum training differences all differences animal differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev difference osmosis diffusion we often heard certain terms science lectures remember certain way several terms help daily lives well out terms osmosis diffusion terms many us might know two terms mean so let us begin discussion knowing terms separately knowing difference two osmosis defined movement solvent molecules permeable membrane solvent moves much higher solute concentration spontaneous movement helps equalize concentration sides now solvent any substance dissolves completely solute called solvent solvent water biological systems final result combination solvent solute called solution solvents majorly used paints inks osmosis physical process laymans language osmosis defined process wherein solvent moves membrane thereby separating two concentrations osmosis works osmotic pressure now osmotic pressure kind external pressure used stop solvents movement moving membrane kind pressure often depends upon substance concentration substance concentration used measure concentration solute osmosis one important processes biology process osmosis undergoes semipermeable membranes molecular substances ions proteins etc cannot pass membranes molecular substances permeable lipids like oxygen nitrogen carbon dioxide etc penetration molecules depends upon solubility substance along size solute instance water molecule travels plasma membrane well osmosis one primary methods used transporting water cells method also used releasing water cells now let us discuss historical points regarding osmosis osmosis first observed egyptian pyramids proof saw initiation osmotic flow ancient times antoine nollet discovered osmotic flow word osmosis comes two greek words ie endosmose exosmose two terms coined rene henri dutrochet french scientist he observed osmotic flow within substances moritz traube made membranes making technology easy osmotic pressure flow historical points regarding osmosis now let us look osmosis process works osmosis process mechanism shown biology chemistry textbooks wherein dilution water solute here water solvent dilutes solute give us solution instance pour salt water dissolves water molecule hand put oil water dissolve water molecules thus dilution take place conditions well interesting note osmotic pressure supports plants major way three kinds solution osmotic pressure ie hypertonic hypotonic isotonic when plant cell placed hypertonic solution water released cell resulting cell shrinking hand plant cell placed hypotonic solution water moved cell resulting swelling cell laymans language means cell diluted solute higher concentration cell shrinks hand cell diluted lower concentration solute cell swells severe situations cell may even burst now let us talk diffusion diffusion completely different osmosis diffusion movement molecule irrespective solvent insolvent atoms ions etc transferred solute higher concentration lower concentration physics biology chemistry economics etc use concept diffusion vividly main aim diffusion solution higher concentration word diffusion comes latin word diffunderes meaning spread two types diffusion processes ie fickian diffusion nonfickian diffusion fickian diffusion called normal diffusion proportion molar fluxes molar flux process substance passed one concentration another nonfickian diffusion called anomalous diffusion nonlinear proportion substances concept used science mathematics wherein passing substances proportional now let us see historical points regarding diffusion thomas graham first experiment diffusion he experimented diffusion gases invented diffusion phenomena year thomas grahams experiments inspired james maxwell invented diffusion coefficient carbon dioxide year adolf fick gave law diffusion year fick law law represents proportion higher lower concentrations solutes robert boyle gave diffusion solids theory th historical points regarding diffusion now differences two terms major differences osmosis diffusion given osmosis limited liquid form ie water solvent hand diffusion seen gases liquids solids osmotic process done semipermeable membrane whereas diffusion doesnt require membrane main solvent osmosis water whereas diffusion water required circumstance osmosis solvent molecules easily dissolved hand diffusion solvent solute molecules easily diffused osmosis process happens one particular direction whereas diffusion process occurs directions osmosis process stopped reversed applying osmotic pressure hand diffusion process cannot stopped reversed osmosis occurs among similar solutions diffusion happen similar dissimilar kinds solutions minerals nutrients associated osmosis process diffusion process minerals nutrients play vital role osmosis depends upon potential solute get dissolved solvent hand diffusion depend upon potential solute major differences osmosis diffusion both osmosis diffusion different processes involve molecular reactions dissolved solute high low concentration thus osmosis diffusion separate processes react differently
