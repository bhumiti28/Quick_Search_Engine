provide middleware solutions development philosophy different both provide similar functional range code looks identical section discuss difference ejb spring ejb ejb acronym enterprise javabeans java api used distributed componentbased programming specifies bean format outlines set services provided container bean runs reason developers need worried services like security transaction support etc application server jboss weblogic etc required run ejb application although spring framework sued application server spring applications locked spring specific services choose integrate spring framework spring spring opensource lightweight framework offers many features ioc transaction management jdbc exception handling etc layered architecture allows us choose necessary components starting development also supports frameworks hibernate jsf ejb etc spring framework forces developers emphasize business requirements rather architectural details application design spring framework sits top application servers service libraries while ejb framework integrated application servers service integration code encapsulated behind interface thus optimize performance developer experience working application server level example tie jpa engine closely jta transaction management therefore ejb perfect features still missing like injection nonmanaged components like simple pojos difference between ejb spring key difference ejb spring ejb specification java ee spring framework implementation another key difference spring support propagation transaction context across remote calls ejb ejb specially designed transactional component programming used develop serverside application while spring provides infrastructure configuration lets developer focus business requirements sn basis comparison ejb spring transaction management supports jta transaction manager supports multiple transactions jta hibernate jdo jdbc dependency injection inject lists properties maps jndi resources inject ejbs data jms jpa resources container persistence supports programmatic beanmanaged persistence tightly integrated jpa provides framework supports integration various persistence technologies like jdbc hibernate jdo ibatis state management supports stateful session beans extended persistence context supports web container session management web services provides supports jaxws support direct web service integration distributed computing provides container manages remote method calls also provides support remote method calls rmi web services jaxrpc messaging supports outofbox messaging capabilities message divan beans listeners configuration added dealing messaging scheduling simple scheduling achieved ejb timer service scheduling quartz must added configured aop provides limited support interceptors supports aspectj spring aop alliance security declarative programmatic security achieved jaas provide outofbox security implementation we use acegi framework achieve clustering most containers builtin support complex thirdparty solution available what use want develop application lots configuration control container level go spring want spend much time configuration application predefined tech stack use ejb can spring replace ejb spring developed alternative ejb beginning all components ejb integrated spring hence use spring instead ejb spring encourages good objectoriented design practice advantage using spring easily switch di frameworks guice next topicfascinating number java prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others
