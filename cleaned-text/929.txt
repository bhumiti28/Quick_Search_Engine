used one documents created overall design example microsoft word might use template making biodata resume format business letter overall design layout resume designed placeholder text allows replace information relevant program may come predesigned templates allow users create template when creating custom template terms saving reusing sharing may include theme effects layouts theme fonts even content templates design dependent work user creating completed work similar themes patterns shared compared layout story page design template different photo gallery page microsoft powerpoint program contains various design templates make documents effective offer cohesive visual organization presentations you add different design graphics slide gives better presentation content microsoft office programs templates available like google docs adobe indesign design programs template may also described following web design template also known web page template page template helps structure overall design web page provided suppliers web designer helps make web design effective lot easier displays features website when designing website templates allow add text images widgets items like navigation bars hundreds different templates provided companies like squarespace help users make website attractive easily essentially website template offers users various easier ways make effective design website built web designing languages like html hypertext markup language css cascading style sheets may cover numerous features stripes background banners square round pictures cautiously laid titles including styled laid typography website templates provide responsive layout website one useful elements responsive websites websites adjust size according display screen help small businesses organizations customers smartphones users get websites services smartphone easily helps increase business growth cases responsive website template provides modern mobilefriendly interface website allows users business owners put images data directly responsive website legacy website template programming feature used basis unique units code objectoriented programming language c programmers select individual template classes modify available various standard template libraries example template mfcl stands microsoft foundation class library especially templates used multiple inheritances operator overloading valuable utility c templates reduce debugging efforts well reduce coding effort associated different data types two kinds template provided c implement general constructs like vector stacks lists stacks class template class template prefixed following term however resembles regular class definition template class typename identifier followed class body declaration class templates c best suited container classes member function definitions declarations header file function template type template implemented help template parameters template parameter used pass type function argument special parameter type thus without repeating overall code functionality may conditioned one type class type parameter function template declared either template typename identifier function declaration template class identifier function declaration class type name keywords difference generally typechecking needed templates compiletime offering special definitions templategenerated code may overridden specific types called template specialization furthermore given set template arguments special version function called explicit specialization advantages c templates you define family functions classes help c templates ability operate different kinds information use templates provides benefits situations offer result duplication code different types instance create set functions use function templates use different data types also developing set typesafe classes class templates also used compared void pointers c macros sometimes templates better solution especially beneficial working smart pointers collections templates also useful terms development time drastically reduce development time main reason use combination stl template classes could preferred runtime resolved code structures typesafe parameters known compile time when using template modern techniques help reduce code bloat however techniques complex disadvantages c templates problem compilers exhibited poor support templates therefore somewhere decreases code portability when many compilers detect template definition error lack clear instructions lead increase hardness developing templates reckless use templates lead code bloat compilers ability generate advanced code template types leads larger executables instance generic image library gil implements type generators used adobe products template exposes implementation nature use impoliticly larger systems may reason longer build times code developed template difficult debug also debugger faces problem locating code runtime compiler replaces templates writing conventional libraries templates used however stl collection template classes next topichistory computer networking prev next videos join our
