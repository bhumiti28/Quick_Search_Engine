difference utp stp cable need learn term twisted pair cable twisted pair cable widely used cable transmitting data information certain distances twisted pair cable consists two separate insulated copper wires twisted together within wrapping shield run parallel furthermore helps reduce crosstalk electromagnetic induction pair wires twisted pair cable divided two parts stp utp utp unshielded twisted pair utp unshielded twisted pair cable used computer telecommunications mediums its frequency range suitable transmitting data voice via utp cable therefore widely used telephone computers etc pair insulated copper wires twisted together reduce noise generated external interference wire additional shielding like aluminium foil protect data exterior advantages utp less costly less expensive unshielded wire another network medium designed reduce crosstalk rfi emi its size small hence installation utp easier mostly useful shortdistance network connections like home small organizations commonly used networking cable market considered faster copperbased data transmission cable suitable transmitting data voice via utp cable disadvantage utp used length segment meters limited bandwidth transmitting data provide secure connection data transmitting network stp shielded twisted pair shielded twisted pair type twisted pair cable contains extra wrapping foil copper braid jacket protect cable defects like cuts losing bandwidth noise signal interference cable usually used underground therefore costly utp supports higher data transmission rates across long distance we also say cable metal sheath coating surround pair insulated conductor protect wire external users prevent electromagnetic noise penetrating features shielded twisted pair cable frequency higher frequency data transmission compared utp thickness thick shielded twisted pair cable contains wrapping plastic material copper conductor grounding practices uses shielded twisted pair cable underground longer distance installation shielded wire difficult utp unshielded twisted pair cable advantages stp cable lower noise attenuation utp shielded plastic cover protects stp cable harsh environment increases data transmission rate reduces chances crosstalk protects external interference modular connection helps terminate connection stp cable disadvantages stp cable expensive wire utp cables requires maintenance reduce loss data signals segment improvement length despite thick heavier connection used grounded wire difference utp stp following differences utp stp follows utp stp unshielded twisted pair shielded twisted pair utp cable twisted pair cable wires twisted together enclosed within foil mesh shield price utp lower compared stp price stp much costlier utp require grounding cable requires grounding cable utp electromagnetic interference stp transferring signal transmission media reduces electromagnetic interference transferring signal transmission media utp high crosstalk stp low crosstalk transferring speed data signal slow compared stp transferring speed data signal high compared utp installation utp cables easy lighter small size flexible installation stp cable quite difficult compared utp its size heavy bigger stiffer require much maintenance requires maintenance utp cables noisier stp cables less noisy however utp cable used establish connection within short distance like home small industry generally used establish connection enterprises long distance next topiccomputer network mcq prev next videos join our youtube channel join now help others please
