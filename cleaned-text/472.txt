whether literal constant variable latter may able evolve components adjust duration could set creation string generally acknowledged information form often represented byte term range information structure uses character encoding preserve series components usually letters sequence also designate generalized arrays forms arrangements sequence array information variable defined sequence may either cause immediate space permanently assigned fixed maximum size implement active dynamic allocation contain dynamic number elements depending programming language correct information type used when sequence explicitly occurs code classified specific string invisible string string finite series symbols selected structure known alphabet mathematical expressions used mathematical logic conceptual computer science string datatypes datatype string datatype modeled structured sequence concept strings data form effective necessary introduced almost every computer programming language accessible primitive data types specific languages synthetic varieties others structure many highlevel programming languages enables occurrence string datatype interpreted string typically referenced certain manner metastring called symbolic string literal string length while structured strings may absolute fixed length often restrict strings size imaginary maximum specific languages besides two kinds string data types strings specified length defined maximum size calculated time compilation use similar amount storage space whether maximum required strings variable size arbitrary finite size might using different amounts storage runtime based exact parameters variablelength strings bulk sequences programming languages although variablelength strings example restricted size amount memory storage usable strings length processed different integer number give size another arbitrary barrier impliedly revocation character usually character quality null bits computer language c character encoding traditionally string datatypes assigned one byte per character still real character set diverse province character implementations sufficiently similar prevent developers disregarding programs specially prepared characters time frame storage comma similar place unicode characters project would encounter traditionally character series based ascii ebcdic when message exhibited framework using distinct encryption one processing message often disfigured although somewhat legible some internet users learned read disfigured text unicode kind condensed image many programming languages unicode string datatypes chosen byte source model unicode utf intended earlier mentioned issues older multibyte unicode characters utf utf utf enable developer realize application divisions predefined length distinct characters however main problem poorly built apis mask distinction implementation several languages ruby c enable strings components updated developed called mutable strings value set languages java python must generate new string changes made called permanent sequences languages also provide another mutable type java net stringbuilder threadsafe java string buffer cocoa ns mutable string usually strings configured sequences bytes characters code items allow easy access excluding characters finite size separate groups substrings alternatively couple languages like haskell incorporate relational databases representation string string representations highly dependent availability text catalog conventional cryptographic system former implementations strings designed operate asciidefined catalog encryption modern enhancements iso international organizations standardizations sequence unicodes substantial accompaniment together range essential embedding like utf utf often used advanced functionalities word byte string tends indicate sequence bytes specific purposes instead strings readable texts strings sections something like byte strings also indicate bytes may accept input therefore retain information implies neither value treated termination value some strings implement implementations sequences variable lengths inputs store text codes

four bytes infinite number values used unique characters string sequence number bits varies actual size line situations number bytes used utf avoids first portion issue string represented belowmentioned forms bit byte terminated software hardware using unique byte apart zero ending strings historically appeared however often value thats also publishing character several embedded systems use symbol use cdc control data corporation systems means character zero value use zx sequence substring basic language machine data processing devices ibm use new acronym sign bit delineate
