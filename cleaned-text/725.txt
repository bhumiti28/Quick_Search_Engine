memcached used major websites huge data example youtube wikipedia twitter etc memcached used memory caching software easy install windows unix system offers api integration major languages like php java cc python ruby perl etc stores data based key values small arbitrary strings objects including results database calls api calls page rendering history memcached memcached originally developed brad fitzpatrick danga interactive livejournal written perl rewritten c anatoly vorobey components memcached memcached made main components components allow client server work together order deliver cached data efficiently possible client software used give list available memcached servers clientbased hashing algorithm chooses server based key server software used store values keys internal hash table lru lru stands least recently used determines throw old data reuse memory features memcached open source scalable add boxes memory spare memcached runs standalone service so take application cached data remain memory long service runs memcached server big hash table reduces database load efficient websites high database load cache nodes ignorant means knowledge nodes participating handles management configuration system extremely easy distributed bsd berkeley software distribution license client server application udp tcp disadvantages memcached fault tolerant tool compared inmemory cache slow mostly serialization deserialization network latency cache nodes ignorant example way iterate cached items persistent datastore how memcached work mentioned memcached four main components components allow store retrieve data each item comprised key expiration time raw data highlevel memcached works follows client requests piece data memcached checks see stored cache may possibility two possible outcomes data stored cache return data memcached need check database data stored cache query database retrieve data subsequently store memcached whenever information modified expiry value item expired memcached update cache ensure fresh content delivered client setup various memcached servers many clients clients use hasing algorithm determine memcahed storage server use helps distribute load server computes second hash key order determine store corresponding value internal hash table some important things memcached architecture data sent one server servers dont share data
