class predefined group classes data set data characterization data sub structure data discrimination show answer workspace answer d explanation discrimination refers mapping classification class predefined groups classes so correct answer d analysis performed uncover interesting statistical correlation associated attributes value pairs known mining association mining correlation mining clusters all show answer workspace answer b explanation mining correlation refers additional analysis performed uncovering interesting statistical correlation associatedattributevalue pairs which one following defined data object comply general behavior model available data evaluation analysis outliner analysis classification prediction show answer workspace answer b explanation may defined object doesnt comply general behavior model available data which one following statements correct data cleaning refers process data cleaning refers transformation wrong data correct data refers correcting inconsistent data all show answer workspace answer d explanation data cleaning kind process applied data set remove noise data noisy data inconsistent data given data also involves process transformation wrong data transformed correct data well words also say data cleaning kind preprocess given set data prepared data warehouse classification data mining system involves database technology information science machine learning all show answer workspace answer d explanation generally classification data mining system depends following criteria database technology machine learning visualization information science several disciplines order integrate heterogeneous databases many types approaches data warehousing show answer workspace answer d explanation general data warehousing consist data integration data cleaning data consolidations therefore integrate heterogeneous databases two approaches updatedriven approach querydriven approach so correct answer d issues

information effectively huge collection data databases data mining algorithm must efficient scalable therefore correct answer which following correct advantage updatedriven approach approach provides high performance data copied processed integrated annotated summarized restructured semantic data store advance both b none show answer workspace answer c explanation statements given b advantage updatedriven approach data warehousing so correct answer c which following statements query tools correct tools developed query database attributes database table take numerical values both b none show answer workspace answer explanation query tools used query database also say tools generally used get necessary information entire database which one following correctly defines term cluster group similar objects differ significantly objects symbolic representation facts ideas information potentially extracted operations database transform simplify data order prepare machinelearning algorithm all show answer workspace answer explanation term cluster refers set similar objects items differ significantly available objects words understand clusters making groups objects contain similar characteristics form available objects therefore correct answer which one following refers binary attribute takes two values general values coded one bit natural environment certain species systems used without knowledge internal operations all show answer workspace answer explanation general binary attribute takes two types values values coded one bit so correct answer which following
