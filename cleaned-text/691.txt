robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops r also software environment used analyze statistical information graphical representation reporting data modeling r implementation s programming language combined lexical scoping semantics r allows us branching looping also allows modular programming using functions r allows integration procedures written c c net python fortran languages improve efficiency present era r one important tool used researchers data analyst statisticians marketers retrieving cleaning analyzing visualizing presenting data history r programming history r goes back years ago r developed ross lhaka robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops programming language name taken name developers first project considered initial version released stable beta version released following table shows release date version description r language versionrelease date description first time rs source released cran comprehensive r archive network started r officially gets gnu license updatepackages installpackages included first productionready version released first version mac os made available first version mac os made available add support utf encoding internationalization localization etc add support windows bit systems added function rapidly converts code byte code added new packages improved serialization speed long vectors support larger numeric values bit systems justintime compilation jit enabled default added new features compact internal representation integer sequences serialization format etc features r programming r domainspecific programming language aims data analysis unique features make powerful important arguably notation vectors vectors allow us perform complex operation set values single command following features r programming simple effective programming language well developed data analysis software welldesigned easy effective language concepts userdefined looping conditional various io facilities consistent incorporated set tools used data analysis different types calculation arrays lists vectors r contains suite operators provides effective data handling storage facility opensource powerful highly extensible software provides highly extensible graphical techniques allows us perform multiple calculations using vectors r interpreted language why use r programming several tools available market perform data analysis learning new languages time taken data scientist use two excellent tools ie r python we may time learn time get started learn data science learning statistical modeling algorithm important learn programming language programming language used compute communicate discovery important task data science way deal data clean feature engineering feature selection import primary focus data scientist job understand data manipulate expose best approach machine learning best algorithms implemented r keras tensorflow allow us create highend machine learning techniques r package perform xgboost xgboost one best algorithms kaggle competition r communicate languages possibly calls python java c big data world also accessible r we connect r different databases like spark hadoop brief r great tool investigate explore data elaborate analysis clustering correlation data reduction done r comparison r python data science deals identifying extracting representing meaningful information data source r python sas sql tableau matlab etc useful tools data science r python used ones still becomes confusing choose better suitable one among two r python comparison index r python overview r interpreted computer programming language created ross ihaka robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops r r also software environment used analyze statistical information graphical representation reporting data modeling python interpreted highlevel programming language used generalpurpose programming guido van rossum created first released python simple clean code syntax emphasizes code readability debugging also simple easier python specialties data science r packages advanced techniques useful statistical work cran text view provided many useful r packages packages cover everything psychometrics genetics finance finding outliers data set r python equally good developing web service allow peoples upload datasets find outliers python better functionalities data analysis r inbuilt functionalities most data analysis functionalities inbuilt available packages like numpy pandas key domains application data visualization key aspect analysis r packages ggplot ggvis lattice etc make data visualization easier python better deep learning
