humidity amount water vapor present air lot water vapor present air humidity likely high atmospheres variable feature significant factor environment weather various reasons atmospheric water vapor important element atmosphere controls air temperature absorbing thermal radiation earth sun also higher atmospheres vapor content available latent energy storm generation moreover main cause types condensation precipitation water vapor water vapor reaches atmosphere mainly evaporating water earths surface including seas atmospheres water vapor content differs place place time time temperature defines airs humidity capacity c f example volume air contain water vapor whereas c f carry types humidity mainly three types humidity follows absolute humidity relative humidity specific humidity absolute humidity mass water vapor separated mass dry air given volume air certain temperature represented grams per cubic meter air gm moisture ppm maximum absolute humidity humid water c f approximately g water vapor gm c f mean absolute humidity cold air around g water vapor gm relative humidity amount water vapor air referred relative humidity its percentage moisture represents much air hold variation airs actual moisture content barometric pressure temperature higher percentage indicates humid airwater mixture relative humidity critical measure used predictor possibility snow dew fog weather forecasts summer relative humidity increases human temperature preventing evaporation perspiration temperature relative humidity used detect content water vapor air also ratio amount humidity air maximum humidity air tolerate temperature given temperature relative humidity actual vapor densitysaturation vapor density specific humidity defined mass water vapor unit mass moist air expressed grams vapor per kilogram air air conditioning grains per pound specific humidity incredibly useful quantity meteorology specific humidity unit reliable unit used measure humidity measures water vapor weight per air vapor weight expressed grams water vapor per kilogram air gkg effects humidity various effects humidity some follows electronics electronic devices designed work particular conditions humidity moisture increase conduction permeable insulators resulting malfunction high humid conditions low humidity leaves materials brittle condensation major danger electronic products irrespective established humidity range when electronic object moved cold place say workshop moist place home condensation coats electronic components insulators shortcircuit equipment low humidity encourages static electricity buildup contributing shutdown computers discharge occurs asthma allergy symptoms humidity air decreased belowstandard levels nasal passages become drier make allergy symptoms worse make allergies prone feeling pain irritation even sinus infections develop side high humidity facilitates production mold mildew dust mites allergens affect wellbeing health equally negatively air also become harder breathe lead increased risk asthma attack triggers conditions sufferers maintaining proper control humidity protect creating problems ensuring nasal passages enough moisture acts kind buffer allergic asthmatic symptoms promotes triggers reduced mental stimulation place exponentially pressure bodies relative humidity levels imbalanced forcing work harder operate normally would result may often difficult concentrate stay mentally invested poorly humidified environments overheating increased perspiration given humidity atmosphere influence temperature still persuade bodies temperatures higher its conditions relative humidity levels higher moisture persists skin allowing dissipate quickly our bodies also cause us sweat attempt overcome sensation naturally
