differences finance differences food differences geography differences differences law differences medical differences politics differences science differences miscellaneous differences next prev g vs g difference between g g we living world technology technology upgraded passage time similarly networking telecom sector seen various generations like g g g g g however upgraded generation contains benefits previous generation when discuss difference g g usually talk specifically connectivity speed parameters connectivity standard parameter evaluate strength quality value generation further parameters like speed distance population density etc also define performance internet technology g latest technology evolving market high speed reliability whereas g used lots customers across world due various advantages previous generations lots service providers provide g connectivity small consumer markets many service providers also integrating implementing old versions g topic discuss various differences g g parameters make g superior g what g g fifthgeneration mobile network technology g digital cellular networks service area covered small geographical area geographical areas called cells g networks designed way connect everyone everything together all analog signals converted digital signal adac analog digital converters form bits all g wireless devices communicated radio waves cell help local antenna transceivers local antennas connected internet telephone network via high bandwidth bw optical fiber g network frequency reused cells g network serve million users per square kilometer g network support users per square kilometer g devices also enabled g lte network means user moving area g networks accessible device use g lte network advantages g better coverage area less traffic high data speed edge cell provide good efficiency terms energy spectrum multiple data transfer capacities g technologies consume low battery comparison g g g g per security terms g secure rest g supports virtual private network vpn low latency time taken data origin destination g regulate bandwidth requirement according application application requires low bw whereas require high bw g connect devices simultaneously technologies disadvantages g g requires high investment infrastructure development upgradation degradation also costly g provides high data speed requires storage capacity smartphones also requires huge battery power specific standard known g till g volte wifi cheaper easily feasible wifi already better alternative g requires high costs maintenance wifi g network technologies working mode still lots drawbacks take time operational globally what latency g latency defined time taken data packet move one place another simple words webpage loading time latency high webpage loading time also high latency low loading time webpage also low g contains less latency means g fast response well faster load times internet g ms latency g lte ms what g g fourthgeneration mobile network technology much faster g follows features previous two technologies g g g based upon whatever features g provides much faster speed sometimes g also known g lte technically incorrect lte single type g advanced technology adopted majority mobile network service providers g network ensures users whatever task want perform amount data maintain stable speed approximately everywhere g wireless network purely data connection endtoend protocol connection advantages g g networks provide flexibility mobility reliable data services g networks downloading uploading speeds much faster wired g g networks even rural areas also works mobile internet connection mobile phones hence need phone line g networks provide area coverage miles overlapping network ranges ensures complete connectivity time provides complete security privacy safety issue wifi networks using g users contain sensitive information mobile devices use internet securely enables users choose many options disadvantages g old devices support g network hence customer forced buy new device make use g network g technology uses various antennas transmitters users would experience poor battery life mobile phone using network so use internet longer period need battery power g easier obtain information users illegally may attacked jamming frequencies hence chances privacy breach increased g networks need complex hardware areas yet g mobile network users would forced use g wifi connectivity using g instead g network users would still pay amount specified g network plan issue resolved mobile carriers expand network coverage include regions g network g networks higher data prices users g network needs expensive infrastructure operation g optimal data rates necessarily best voice services feature differences g g speed first important factor differentiating g g technologies speed g expected times faster g among available mobile technologies g network fastest slower g g reach maximum speed mbps real world maximum mbps higher speed g possible networks builton superhigh frequency airwaves highband spectrum higher frequency data transferred theoretical maximum speed g gbps real world mbs gbps capacity many devices using network one place cause congestion network infrastructure capable handling mass devices hence leads slower data speeds even g networks also issue solved g technology expected capacity compared g allow connecting lots devices network without congestion latency latency delay amount time network takes device communicate another device server measured milliseconds latency less g networks ms g networks virtually zero ms g network low latency helpful realtime gaming selfdriving cars iot applications etc technologies g technology developed accommodate different technologies lwaltewlan support connectivity dense environments g technology improves step improve spectral efficiency connection quality mainly dense urban environment machine type communication g designed work consumers well enterprises capable machinetype communication needed iot applications m mtype connected devices whereas g iot applications need work adapted g g technologies architecture g technologies designed way take benefit cloudbased virtual radio access network ran g technologies capable working ran radio access network technology allows enterprises service providers set centralized network providers also take benefits localized data centers provide faster reliable internet connection users device intelligence g networks comparatively intelligent compared g g identify fixed devices mobile devices identifies device help cognitive radio techniques hence provides suitable delivery channel means g user get customized internet connection per device compatibility local reception environment bandwidth g expected bandwidth compared g g use available spectrum efficiently compared g g uses narrow slice available spectrum mhz ghz whereas g divided three different bands each band contains range speed hence different bands used different use cases businesses enterprises comparison chart g g g technology g technology g stands fourthgeneration technology g stands fifthgeneration technology maximum theoretical uploading speed g technology mbps maximum uploading speed g technology gbps maximum theoretical downloading speed g gbps maximum downloading speed g gbps latency g approximately ms latency g approximately ms g network slow less efficient comparing g network g fastest efficient mobile network g technology unable differentiate fixed mobile devices g technology capable identifying fixed mobile devices help cognitive radio technique hence offer suitable delivery channel conclusion per discussion say although g broadly used everywhere due higher speed reliability nextgeneration technology g per expectations g network provides speed efficiency everyone needs next topicdifference prev next videos join our youtube channel
