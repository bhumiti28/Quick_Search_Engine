applications want run nodejs certain dependencies necessitate certain libraries specific kind operating system example order install mysql requires libraries dependencies specific requirements operating system likewise run multiple software one require library well dependency may even cause conflict necessarily application ask libraries specific version may need different version library now question solve issue because eventually end dependency matrix hell cannot upgrade maintain matrix hell solve dependency matrix hell upgrading software applications utilize containers containers build application ship application deploy scale applications ease independently containers vs vms order learn container recommended first know varies traditional virtual machine vm case traditional virtualization hypervisor leveraged virtualize physical hardware regardless onpremises cloud virtual machine exists guest operating system virtual blueprint hardware required os run accompanied application connected libraries dependencies containers virtualize operating system typically linux rather virtualizing hidden hardware particular container include libraries dependencies corresponding application containers fast portable lightweight due absence guest operating system architecture container similar traditional ones container also operating system hardware top hardware container engine docker container engine software creates container packages libraries dependencies alongside facilitate effortless movement container one machine another libraries dependencies come part package nothing container way different containers easily moved across virtual machines regardless worrying underlying dependencies may required application run everything needed application run packaged container move around advantages containers installation traditional scenario installing application laborious task require run several commands checking multiple dependencies fact may end going several dependencies software conflicts resolved install application development environment repeat whole process back forth reason termed timeconsuming task thus resolve issue require containers everything packaged all got move followed running single command result automatic installation dependencies libraries deprived conflicting others software dependencies already discussed traditional model software dependency one problematic issue resolved containers packages dependencies inside container isolate since move containers one system another easily manageable packaging resolve compatibility issues container packages software easily shipped without causing fuss isolation containers also help process isolation track going improve security scalability containers scalable contrast traditional development system scale application horizontally scale independent containers utilize load balancer service result splitting traffic since containers flexible makes sure
