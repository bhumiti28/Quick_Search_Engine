black death black death also known plague wherein around million people died th century interesting note disease kills particular person group people cannot called pandemic disease infectious spreads worldwide called pandemic pandemic involves deadly contagious disease spreads widely person person country country now let us look assess pandemic pandemic assessed two ways ie knowing disease stages taking note severity caused disease humans so let us discuss separately world health organization given classification table describes stages pandemic first stage animal infects human one rare cases pandemic takes place animal second stage happens virus transmitted one person another directly instance common cold flu contagious spreads one person another third final stage happens virus spreads people community from community virus spread worldwide widespread disease called pandemic according world health organization four intervals pandemic ie initiation acceleration deceleration preparation talking terms severity cases lot problem arises some points listed people infected virus die several weeks months later due virus cause detected cases fatality rate goes higher government might know number people suffering fatal disease record particular pandemic history one cannot cure pandemic medical services provided time due negligence hospitals health workers virus spreads widely rapid rate key points regarding pandemic solution managing pandemic contain particular area country widespread virus some notable pandemics history plague athens antonine plague plague cyprian plague
