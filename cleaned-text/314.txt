mcq next prev convert infix postfix notation before understanding conversion infix postfix notation know infix postfix notations separately infix postfix expressions expression consists constants variables symbols symbols operators parenthesis all components must arranged according set rules expressions evaluated using set rules examples expressions b p all expressions common structure ie operator two operands operand object value operation performed expressions operands operators what infix notation when operator written operands known infix notation operand always constant variable also expression example p q r expression expressions multiplication operator operands ie p q r operands expression three operators operands first plus operator p q operands second plus operator r while performing operations expression need follow set rules evaluate result expression addition operation would performed two expressions ie p q r s multiplication operation would performed syntax infix notation given operand operator operand one operator expression require applying rule example expression addition operation performed two operands result operation would multiple operators expression rule needs followed evaluate expression expression plus operator evaluated first expression would look like multiplication operator evaluated first expression would look like problem resolved following operator precedence rules algebraic expression order operator precedence given table operators symbols parenthesis exponents multiplication division addition subtraction first preference given parenthesis next preference given exponents case multiple exponent operators operation applied right left example after exponent multiplication division operators evaluated operators present expression operation applied left right next preference given addition subtraction operators available expression go left right operators precedence termed operator associativity go left right known leftassociative go right left known rightassociative problem infix notation evaluate infix expression know operator precedence rules operators precedence follow associativity rules use parenthesis important infix notation control order operation performed parenthesis improves readability expression infix expression common way writing expression easy parse evaluate infix expression without ambiguity so mathematicians logicians studied problem discovered two ways writing expressions prefix postfix both expressions require parenthesis parsed without ambiguity require operator precedence associativity rules postfix expression postfix expression expression operator written operands example postfix expression infix notation written some key points regarding postfix expression postfix expression operations performed order written left right require parenthesis we need apply operator precedence rules associativity rules algorithm evaluate postfix expression scan expression left right encounter operator perform operation replace expression computed value repeat steps operators exist lets understand algorithm example infix expression we start scanning left expression multiplication operator operator appears first scanning left right now expression would expression again scan left right expression would expression evaluation postfix expression using stack scan expression left right encounter operand expression push operand stack when encounter operator expression pop corresponding operands stack when finish scanning expression final value remains stack lets understand evaluation postfix expression using stack example postfix expression input stack empty push push push pop perform push stack pop stack perform push stack result expression example postfix expression input stack empty push push pop stack perform push stack push push pop stack perform push stack pop stack perform push stack result expression algorithm evaluate postfix expression read character character digit convert character int push integer stack character operator pop elements stack twice obtaining two operands perform operation push result stack conversion infix postfix here use stack data structure conversion infix expression prefix expression whenever operator encounter push operator stack encounter operand append operand expression rules conversion infix postfix expression print operand arrive stack empty contains left parenthesis top push incoming operator stack incoming symbol push stack incoming symbol pop stack print operators left parenthesis found incoming symbol higher precedence top stack push stack incoming symbol lower precedence top stack pop print top stack test incoming operator new top stack incoming operator precedence top stack use associativity rules associativity left right pop print top stack push incoming operator associativity right left push incoming operator end expression pop print operators stack lets understand example
