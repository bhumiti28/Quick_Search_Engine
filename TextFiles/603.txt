Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at the number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers. The foremost reason to learn C over assembly language is that it's quite easier and faster to write code in C than in assembly language for a given programming task. With C, you just have to write a few lines of code and complete the job quickly without much stressing your mind than if you write it in assembly language. Why Take This Course?
