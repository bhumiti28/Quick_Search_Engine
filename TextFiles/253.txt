You need to recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. It’s utilized in production by large companies like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc. Why to learn NodeJS? Easy Scalability Real time web apps Fast Suite Easy to learn and code Advantage of Caching Data Streaming Hosting Corporate Support Example:
