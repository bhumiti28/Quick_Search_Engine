The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. For example: The below list of characters is sorted in increasing order of their ASCII values. That is, the character with lesser ASCII value will be placed first than the character with higher ASCII value. ‘Recent Articles’ on Sorting Topic : Basic Sorting Algorithms Library Implementations of Sorting Algorithms Misc Coding Problems Quick Links Basic : Sorting Terminology Stability in sorting algorithms Time complexities of Standard Sorting Algorithms External Sorting Sorting Algorithms : Selection Sort Bubble Sort Recursive Bubble Sort Insertion Sort Recursive Insertion Sort Merge Sort Iterative Merge Sort Quick Sort Iterative Quick Sort Heap Sort Counting Sort Radix Sort Bucket Sort ShellSort TimSort Comb Sort Pigeonhole Sort Cycle Sort Cocktail Sort Strand Sort Bitonic Sort Pancake sorting Binary Insertion Sort BogoSort or Permutation Sort Gnome Sort Sleep Sort – The King of Laziness / Sorting while Sleeping Structure Sorting (By Multiple Rules) in C++ Stooge Sort Tag Sort (To get both sorted and original) Tree Sort Cartesian Tree Sorting Odd-Even Sort / Brick Sort QuickSort on Singly Linked List QuickSort on Doubly Linked List 3-Way QuickSort (Dutch National Flag) Merge Sort for Linked Lists Merge Sort for Doubly Linked List 3-way Merge Sort Library Implementations of Sorting Algorithms : Know Your Sorting Algorithm | Set 1 (Sorting Weapons used by Programming Languages) Know Your Sorting Algorithm | Set 2 (Introsort- C++’s Sorting Weapon) Comparator function of qsort() in C sort() in C++ STL C qsort() vs C++ sort() Arrays.sort() in Java with examples Collections.sort() in Java with Examples Misc : Asymptotic Analysis and comparison of sorting algorithms Hoare’s vs Lomuto partition scheme in QuickSort Serial Sort v/s Parallel Sort in Java An Insertion Sort time complexity question Time complexity of insertion sort when there are O(n) inversions?
