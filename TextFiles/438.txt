It is a pure object-oriented programming language which also provides support to the functional programming approach. Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and can run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language. It also provides Javascript runtimes. Scala is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza etc. Recent Articles on Scala !
