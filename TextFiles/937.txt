SQL Tutorial SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database such as updating records, deleting records, creating and modifying tables, views, etc. SQL is just a query language; it is not a database. To perform SQL queries, you need to install any database, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostGre SQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc. What is SQL SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is designed for managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometime See-Qwell. SQL is a database language, it is used for database creation, deletion, fetching rows, and modifying rows, etc. SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus. All DBMS like MySQL, Oracle, MS Access, Sybase, Informix, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server use SQL as standard database language.
