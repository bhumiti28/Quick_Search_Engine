Example: Input: X = 1, Y = 2, Z = 2 Output: 3 Explanation: Magnitude of the vector is equal to ?9 =3 Input: X = 0, Y = 4, Z = 3 Output: 5 Approach: The magnitude of a vector can be calculated by solving the equation ?(X2 + Y2 + Z2). Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Stores the sum of the squares of the X, Y and Z coordinates in a variable, say sum. Initialize a variable, say magnitude, to store the square root of sum. Print the value of magnitude as the required result. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++14 // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to calculate magnitude // of a 3 dimensional vector float vectorMagnitude(int x, int y, int z) { // Stores the sum of squares // of coordinates of a vector int sum = x * x + y * y + z * z; // Return the magnitude return sqrt(sum); } // Driver Code int main() { int x = 1; int y = 2; int z = 3; cout << vectorMagnitude(x, y, z); return 0; } Output:
