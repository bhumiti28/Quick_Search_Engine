Home Next ? AppML Brings Data to HTML "No Nonsense Web Applications" Introduction The Web is growing fast, and the amount of data in Cyberspace is growing even faster. Every day new information systems are developed, and every day new users are connected, and data can be accessed 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Faster and better software development methods are desperately needed. Along these lines, W3Schools has developed a very flexible technique for retrieving, displaying, and manipulate data, without the need for traditional programming. Cooperating with Jan Egil Refsnes, W3schools has developed a vocabulary for defining Web applications. The vocabulary is called AppML (Application Modeling Language). AppML uses the most up-to-date techniques and ideas of modern Web development with focus on: Low Cost Rapid and Agile Web Develoment Optimized for Cloud Computing High Speed and Low Bandwidth Consumption MVC (Model Viev Controller) Architecture Full Separation of Content from Presentation Highly Scalable and Testable Easy Configuration and Reconfiguration AppML supports the functions you find in other frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, but AppML is much easier to use, and much easier to understand. What is AppML? AppML stands for Application Modeling Language. AppML is not a programming language. It is descriptive language (a language for describing applications). It is built around familiar Web application concepts like: Forms Lists Reports Filters Functions Databases AppML runs in any HTML page. No installation is required. AppML is a tool for bringing data to HTML applications: From Objects From JSON files From Text files From XML files From databases Objects JSON Files Text Files XML Files PHP/MySQL ASP.NET/SQL Why AppML? HTML is not very suitable for describing web applications. AppML is made for web applications: AppML extends HTML with data attributes. AppML adds controllers to HTML, to control the behavior of HTML data. AppML is very easy to understand and extraordinarily quick to develop. AppML Example This example shows how easy AppML can bring data to HTML: AppML Example <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en-US"> <title>Customers</title> <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/appml/2.0.3/appml.js"></script> <body> <h1>Customers</h1> <table appml-data="customers.js"> <tr> <th>Customer</th> <th>City</th> <th>Country</th> </tr> <tr appml-repeat="records"> <td>{{CustomerName}}</td> <td>{{City}}</td> <td>{{Country}}</td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> Try It Yourself » AppML is a tool for easy, rapid, and agile web application development. Easy and Agile On today's market, there are many frameworks (tools or libraries) designed to extend HTML. Most of these frameworks manipulate HTML, CSS or JavaScript in a way that makes them difficult to use (especially when used in combination). AppML is different. You have full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript freedom. AppML makes it easy to create Single Page Applications (SPA) in a very clean and efficient way. Even if you have never worked with web development before, you will find AppML very easy to use. If you are an experienced web developer, you will soon discover the power of AppML. ? Home Next ?
