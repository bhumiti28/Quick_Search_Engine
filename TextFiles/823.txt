Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
