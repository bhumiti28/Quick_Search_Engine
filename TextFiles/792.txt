If the specified circumstance is met, then only the unique value of the table is returned. To extract the information and retrieve only the correct records, you can use the WHERE statement. Not only, the WHERE condition used in the Selection statement, but it is also used in the UPDATE assertion, DELETE assertion, etc. Syntax Now, we have discussed the syntax of the SELECT statement associated with the WHERE condition. It is shown below- 
SELECT column1, column2, ..... columnN
FROM table_name
WHERE {condition}
 Note: The WHERE condition is used not only in the Selection assertion but also in the UPDATE assertion, the Remove assertion, etc.! You may use contrast or logical operators, such as >, <, =, LIKE, NOT, etc. To define a state. The below-given example will explicitly state this notation. For Example- Here, we consider the table of CUSTOMERS with the below-given records. CustomerID CustomerName Address Age Salary 001 Hardy Thompson Maxico 25 10000.00 002 Sturt Broad Los Angeles 28 25000.00 003 Joseph Winget California 30 56000.00 004 David Anderson Norway 24 76000.00 005 Alexa Denmark 35 23000.00 Now, we will run the below-given query on SQL to fetch the CustomerID, CustomerName and Salary from the above table CUSTOMERS, where the salary is greater than 25000. 
 Select CustomerID, CustomerName, Salary 
from CUSTOMERS
Where Salary > 25000;
 Output After the successful execution of the above SQL query, we got the following output. Here, we have another instance where we would get the CustomerID, CustomerName and Salary from the database table named CUSTOMERS for a specific customer named Joseph Winget. 
Select CustomerID, CustomerName, Salary 
from CUSTOMERS
Where CustomerName = 'Joseph Winget';
 Output After the successful execution of the above SQL query, we got the above-given outcome. Note- Here, it should be noted that all strings should be specified within single quotes (''). So, as in the instance discussed earlier, should provide numerical data without any quotation. Next TopicSQL Injection ? prev next ?
