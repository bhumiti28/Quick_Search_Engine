I have worked on the most straightforward and the most complicated projects, but no matter what the task is, the best way - is the straightforward way. Therefore, in my lectures, I will only cover the things that you will actually need. My goal is to help bring technology and business together, because there is nothing better than an all-rounder in these areas.
