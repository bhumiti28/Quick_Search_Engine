Examples: Input: A = 1, B = -5, C = 6 Output: (6)x^2 +(-5)x + (1) = 0 Explanation: The given quadratic equation x2 – 5x + 6 = 0. Roots of the above equation are 2, 3. Reciprocal of these roots are 1/2, 1/3. Therefore, the quadratic equation with these reciprocal roots is 6x2 – 5x + 1 = 0. Input: A = 1, B = -7, C = 12 Output: (12)x^2 +(-7)x + (1) = 0 Approach: The idea is to use the concept of quadratic roots to solve the problem. Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Consider the roots of the equation Ax2 + Bx + C = 0 to be p, q. The product of the roots of the above equation is given by p * q = C / A. The sum of the roots of the above equation is given by p + q = -B / A. Therefore, the reciprocals of the roots are 1/p, 1/q. The product of these reciprocal roots is 1/p * 1/q = A / C. The sum of these reciprocal roots is 1/p + 1/q = -B / C. If the sum and product of roots is known, the quadratic equation can be x2 – (Sum of the roots)x + (Product of the roots) = 0. On solving the above equation, quadratic equation becomes Cx2 + Bx + A = 0. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++ // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to find the quadratic // equation having reciprocal roots void findEquation(int A, int B, int C) { // Print quadratic equation cout << "(" << C << ")" << "x^2 +(" << B << ")x + (" << A << ") = 0"; } // Driver Code int main() { // Given coefficients int A = 1, B = -5, C = 6; // Function call to find the quadratic // equation having reciprocal roots findEquation(A, B, C); return 0; } Output: 
(6)x^2 +(-5)x + (1) = 0
