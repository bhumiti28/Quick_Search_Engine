Examples: Input: S = “Please refer to the madam to know the level” Output: Please level to the madam to know the refer Explanation: Here “refer”, “madam”, “level” are the palindromic words. Sorting them generates the sequence {“level”, “madam”, “refer”}. Input: S = “refer to dad” Output: dad to refer Approach: Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Iterate over the characters of the string. Split the words in the sentence by spaces using split() and store it as a list, say lis. Store all the palindromic words present in the sentence S in a list, say newlis[]. Sort the list newlis[] using sort() function. Initialize a pointer, say j = 0. Traverse the list lis and replace all the palindromic words with newlis[j] and increment j by 1. Print the updated sentence Below is the implementation of the above approach: Python3 # Python implementation of above program # Function to check if a # string is a palindrome or not def palindrome(string): if(string == string[::-1]): return True else: return False # Function to print the updated sentence def printSortedPalindromes(sentence): # Stores palindromic words newlist = [] # Stores the words split by spaces lis = list(sentence.split()) # Traversing the list for i in lis: # If current word is palindrome if(palindrome(i)): # Update newlist newlist.append(i) # Sort the words in newlist newlist.sort() # Pointer to iterate newlis j = 0 # Traverse the list for i in range(len(lis)): # If current word is palindrome if(palindrome(lis[i])): # Replacing word with # current word in newlist lis[i] = newlist[j] # Increment j by 1 j = j + 1 # Print the updated sentence for i in lis: print(i, end =" ") # Driver Code sentence = "please refer to the madam to know the level" printSortedPalindromes(sentence) Output: 
please level to the madam to know the refer
