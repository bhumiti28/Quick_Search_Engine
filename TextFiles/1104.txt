Examples: Input: x1 = 4, y1 = 8, z1 = 12, x2 = 8, y2 = 16, z2 = 24 Output: Yes Explanation: The given vectors: 4i + 8j + 12k and 8i + 16j + 24k are collinear. Input: x1 = 2, y1 = 8, z1 = -4, x2 = 4, y2 = 16, z2 = 8 Output: No Explanation: The given vectors: 2i + 8j – 4k and 4i + 16j + 8k are not collinear. Approach: The problem can be solved based on the idea that two vectors are collinear if any of the following conditions are satisfied: Two vectors A and B are collinear if there exists a number n, such that A = n · b. Two vectors are collinear if relations of their coordinates are equal, i.e. x1 / x2 = y1 / y2 = z1 / z2. Note: This condition is not valid if one of the components of the vector is zero. Two vectors are collinear if their cross product is equal to the NULL Vector. Therefore, to solve the problem, the idea is to check if the cross-product of the two given vectors is equal to the NULL Vector or not. If found to be true, then print Yes. Otherwise, print No. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++14 // C++ program for the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to calculate cross // product of two vectors void crossProduct(int vect_A[], int vect_B[], int cross_P[]) { // Update cross_P[0] cross_P[0] = vect_A[1] * vect_B[2] - vect_A[2] * vect_B[1]; // Update cross_P[1] cross_P[1] = vect_A[2] * vect_B[0] - vect_A[0] * vect_B[2]; // Update cross_P[2] cross_P[2] = vect_A[0] * vect_B[1] - vect_A[1] * vect_B[0]; } // Function to check if two given // vectors are collinear or not void checkCollinearity(int x1, int y1, int z1, int x2, int y2, int z2) { // Store the first and second vectors int A[3] = { x1, y1, z1 }; int B[3] = { x2, y2, z2 }; // Store their cross product int cross_P[3]; // Calculate their cross product crossProduct(A, B, cross_P); // Check if their cross product // is a NULL Vector or not if (cross_P[0] == 0 && cross_P[1] == 0 && cross_P[2] == 0) cout << "Yes"; else cout << "No"; } // Driver Code int main() { // Given coordinates // of the two vectors int x1 = 4, y1 = 8, z1 = 12; int x2 = 8, y2 = 16, z2 = 24; checkCollinearity(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2); return 0; } Output: 
Yes
