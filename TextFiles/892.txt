The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. Topics : Introduction Implementation Standard Problems Operations on Queue Misc Quick Links Introduction : Queue Applications of Queue Data Structure Priority Queue Applications of Priority Queue Deque Circular Queue Queue Interface In Java Queue In Python Queue In C# Implementation : Implement Queue using Stacks LRU Cache Implementation Implement Stack using Queues Queue | Set 2 (Linked List Implementation) How to efficiently implement k Queues in a single array? Implement a stack using single queue Implementation of Deque using circular array Circular Queue | Set 2 (Circular Linked List Implementation) Implement Stack and Queue using Deque Priority Queue using Linked List Priority Queue using doubly linked list Implementation of Deque using doubly linked list Standard Problems : Check if a queue can be sorted into another queue using a stack Breadth First Traversal or BFS for a Graph Level Order Tree Traversal Reverse a path in BST using queue Construct Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List Representation Program for Page Replacement Algorithms | Set 2 (FIFO) Check whether a given Binary Tree is Complete or not | Set 1 (Iterative Solution) Number of siblings of a given Node in n-ary Tree ZigZag Tree Traversal FIFO (First-In-First-Out) approach in Programming FIFO vs LIFO approach in Programming LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) approach in Programming Operations on Queue : Reversing a Queue Reversing a queue using recursion Reversing the first K elements of a Queue Interleave the first half of the queue with second half Sorting a Queue without extra space Misc : Level order traversal in spiral form Sliding Window Maximum (Maximum of all subarrays of size k) Find the largest multiple of 3 | Set 1 (Using Queue) Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps Smallest multiple of a given number made of digits 0 and 9 only Iterative Method to find Height of Binary Tree Implement PriorityQueue through Comparator in Java An Interesting Method to Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to n Minimum time required to rot all oranges Find maximum level sum in Binary Tree Sum of minimum and maximum elements of all subarrays of size k. Distance of nearest cell having 1 in a binary matrix Level order traversal line by line | Set 2 (Using Two Queues) First negative integer in every window of size k Minimum sum of squares of character counts in a given string after removing k characters Queue based approach for first non-repeating character in a stream Averages of Levels in Binary Tree Stack Permutations (Check if an array is stack permutation of other) Check if all levels of two trees are anagrams or not Check mirror in n-ary tree Check if X can give change to every person in the Queue Quick Links : ‘Practice Problems’ on Queue ‘Videos’ on Queue ‘Quizzes’ on Queue My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Writing code in comment?
