Examples: Input: arr[ ] = {43, 422, 132} Output: 33 53 203 Explanation: The binary representation of the array elements are {101011, 110100110, 10000100}. Reversed binary representations are {110101, 011001011, 0010000}. Equivalent numeric values of the reversed binary representations are {53, 203, 33}. Sorted order of these elements are {33, 53, 203}. Input: arr[ ] ={ 98, 43, 66, 83} Output: 33 35 53 101 Approach: Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Traverse the array arr[] and convert each array element to their equivalent binary representation and store it in the form of a binary string. Reverse these binary strings and convert the reversed binary string to equivalent decimal. Sort the modified array. Print the sorted array. Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++14 // C++ implementation of // the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to convert binary // number to equivalent decimal int binaryToDecimal(string n) { string num = n; int dec_value = 0; // Set base value to 1, i.e 2^0 int base = 1; int len = num.length(); for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) { if (num[i] == '1') dec_value += base; base = base * 2; } return dec_value; } // Function to convert a decimal // to equivalent binary representation string decimalToBinary(int n) { // Stores the binary representation string binstr = ""; while (n > 0) { // Since ASCII value of // '0', '1' are 48 and 49 binstr += (n % 2 + 48); n = n / 2; } // As the string is already reversed, // no further reversal is required return binstr; } // Function to convert the reversed binary // representation to equivalent integer int reversedBinaryDecimal(int N) { // Stores reversed binary // representation of given decimal string decimal_to_binar = decimalToBinary(N); // Stores equivalent decimal // value of the binary representation int binary_to_decimal = binaryToDecimal(decimal_to_binar); // Return the resultant integer return binary_to_decimal; } // Utility function to print the sorted array void printSortedArray(int arr[], int size) { // Sort the array sort(arr, arr + size); // Traverse the array for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) // Print the array elements cout << arr[i] << " "; cout << endl; } // Utility function to reverse the // binary representations of all // array elements and sort the modified array void modifyArray(int arr[], int size) { // Traverse the array for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) { // Passing array elements to // reversedBinaryDecimal function arr[i] = reversedBinaryDecimal( arr[i]); } // Pass the array to // the sorted array printSortedArray(arr, size); } // Driver Code int main() { int arr[] = { 98, 43, 66, 83 }; int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]); modifyArray(arr, n); return 0; } Output:

 Time Complexity: O(NlogN) Auxiliary Space: O(log2M), where M denotes the maximum element present in the array. Attention reader! Don’t stop learning now.
