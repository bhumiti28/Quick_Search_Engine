There are certain rules defined in Java to specify the order in which the operators in an expression are evaluated. Operator precedence is a concept of determining the group of terms in an expression. The operator precedence is responsible for evaluating the expressions. In Java, parentheses() and Array subscript[] have the highest precedence in Java. For example, Addition and Subtraction have higher precedence than the Left shift and Right shift operators. Below is a table defined in which the lowest precedence operator show at the top of it. Precedence Operator Type Associativity 1) = += -= *= /= %= Assignment Addition assignment Subtraction assignment Multiplication assignment Division assignment Modulus assignment Right to left 2) ? : Ternary conditional Right to left 3) || Logical OR Left to right 4) && Logical AND Left to right 5) | Bitwise inclusive OR Left to right 6) ^ Bitwise exclusive OR Left to right 7) & Bitwise AND Left to right 8) != == Relational is not equal to Relational is equal to Left to right 9) < <= > >= instanceof Relational less than Relational less than or equal Relational greater than Relational greater than or equal Type comparison (objects only) Left to right 10) >> << >>> Bitwise right shift with sign extension Bitwise left shift Bitwise right shift with zero extension Left to right 11) - + Subtraction Addition Left to right 12) * / % Multiplication Division Modulus Left to right 13) - + ~ ! ( type) Unary minus Unary plus Unary bitwise complement Unary logical negation Unary typecast Right to left 14) ++ -- Unary post-increment Unary post-decrement Right to left 15) · () [] Dot operator Parentheses Array subscript Left to Right Precedence order When two operators share a single operand, the operator having the highest precedence goes first. For example, x + y * z is treated as x + (y * z), whereas x * y + z is treated as (x * y) + z because * operator has highest precedence in comparison of + operator. Associativity Associative is a concept related to the operators applied when two operators with the same precedence come in an expression. The associativity concept is very helpful to goes from that situation. Suppose we have an expression a + b - c (+ and - operators have the same priority), and this expression will be treated as (a + (b - c)) because these operators are right to left-associative. On the other hand, a+++--b+c++ will be treated as ((a++)+((--b)+(c++))) because the unary post-increment and decrement operators are right to left-associative. An example is defined below to understand how an expression is evaluated using precedence order and associativity? Expression: x = 4 / 2 + 8 * 4 - ( 5+ 2 ) % 3 Solution: 1) In the above expression, the highest precedence operator is (). So, the parenthesis goes first and calculates first. x = 4 / 2 + 8 * 4 - 7 % 3 2) Now, /, * and % operators have the same precedence and highest from the + and - Here, we use the associativity concept to solve them. The associative of these operators are from left to right. So, / operator goes first and then * and % simultaneously. x = 2 + 8 * 4 - 7 % 3 x = 2 + 32 - 7 % 3 x = 2 + 32 - 1 3) Now, + and - operators both also have the same precedence, and the associativity of these operators lest to the right. So, + operator will go first, and then - will go. x = 34 - 1 x = 33 HighestPrecedence.java 
//import classes
import java.util.*;

//creating HighestPrecedence class to evaluate the expression
public class HighestPrecedence {
	
	//main() method starts
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//initialize variables with default values
        int x = 2;
        int y = 5;
        int z = 12;
		
		//calculating exp1, exp2, and exp3 
        int exp1 = x +(z/x+(z%y)*(z-x)^2);
		int exp2 = z/x+y*x-(y+x)%z;
		int exp3 = 4/2+8*4-(5+2)%3;
		
		//printing the result
        System.out.println(exp1);
        System.out.println(exp2);
        System.out.println(exp3);
    }
