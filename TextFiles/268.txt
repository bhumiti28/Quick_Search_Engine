In this course, you will be able to combine all the ways to connect to the database and learn how to make it in an informative and attractive way. Here, you will learn all the basic concepts, tools, functions, and required topics which usually a Java Developer requires during the web application development process. The course starts with Java, including multi-threading, Lambdas, Collections debugging and introduction to GIT. Then we will move towards JSP and Servlets. Once we are done with JSP and Servlets, we will start exploring Hibernate. An application will be built using JSP and Hibernate as well. Java, JSP, and Servlets are core technologies, now once we have completed the core technologies, we will move towards spring framework. Spring framework is among the most popular Java framework, we will cover the spring framework, and then we will start with the very important "Restful web services". Finally, after completion for web-services, we will start with spring boot. Who this course is for: Java programmers who want to create web applications Professionals willing to develop a Java skill Future developers of web applications People willing to create a fast web application using Java Course Content Introduction: Background 4 Lectures 00:12:49 About the course Preview 00:02:12 Meet your instructor Preview 00:01:24 Background Story Preview 00:07:10 Review and rating 00:02:03 Java: Setting up 2 Lectures 00:10:16 Download process and installation of Java (Windows) 00:04:42 Download and installation process of Eclipse 00:05:34 Java: Getting started 11 Lectures 01:08:02 The language of 50 keywords Preview 00:01:21 Our first Java program Preview 00:04:27 Variable and datatype 00:03:54 Understanding variables 00:06:26 Primitive Data Types (Integer datatype) 00:07:15 Primitive Data Types (floating point datatype) 00:10:19 Primitive Data Types (boolean and char) 00:05:41 BigDecimal class introduction 00:05:31 String basics 00:06:44 Type casting 00:16:24 Project files Java: Some good to know information 8 Lectures 01:02:49 Arithmetic operators 00:09:41 Making decision with operators -
