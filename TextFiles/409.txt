Teaching over 300,000 students worldwide, he's helped tens of thousands of people learn web development. From zero to hero and novice to ninja, he's considered a top teacher by thousands.

Kalob's ability to turn complex programming concepts into easy-to-understand bits of knowledge has been called his "superpower". Throughout the years, Kalob has built hundreds, if not thousands, of websites, and has created multiple companies from his ideas and software. He also provides one-on-one coaching and startup consulting to new organizations. Teaching isn't an option in Kalob's life, but a moral obligation to pass on knowledge to others.
