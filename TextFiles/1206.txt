It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL. STL has four components Algorithms Containers Functions Iterators Algorithms The header algorithm defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements.They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers. Algorithm Sorting Searching Important STL Algorithms Useful Array algorithms Partition Operations Numeric valarray class Containers Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors. Sequence Containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner. vector list deque arrays forward_list( Introduced in C++11) Container Adaptors : provide a different interface for sequential containers. queue priority_queue stack Associative Containers : implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity). set multiset map multimap Unordered Associative Containers : implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched unordered_set (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11) unordered_map (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11) Flowchart of Adaptive Containers and Unordered Containers Flowchart of Sequence conatiners and ordered containers Functions The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors. Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed. Functors Iterators As the name suggests, iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values. They are the major feature that allow generality in STL.
