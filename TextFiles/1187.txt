Examples: Input: M = 25, H = 10, V = 15 Output: Kinetic Energy = 2812.5 Potential Energy = 2450 Explanation : The kinetic energy of the particle is 2812.5 and the potential energy is 2450. Input : M=5.5, H=23.5, V= 10.5 Output : 303.188 1266.65 Approach: The required values of Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy can be calculated using the following two formulas: Kinetic Energy = 0.5 * Mass ( M ) * Velocity ( V ) 2 Potential Energy = Mass ( M ) * Height ( H ) * Acceleration due to gravity ( g ) Below is the implementation of the above approach: C++14 // C++ Program to implement // the above approach #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; // Function to calculate Kinetic Energy float kineticEnergy(float M, float V) { // Stores the Kinetic Energy float KineticEnergy; KineticEnergy = 0.5 * M * V * V; return KineticEnergy; } // Function to calculate Potential Energy float potentialEnergy(float M, float H) { // Stores the Potential Energy float PotentialEnergy; PotentialEnergy = M * 9.8 * H; return PotentialEnergy; } // Driver Code int main() { float M = 5.5, H = 23.5, V = 10.5; cout << "Kinetic Energy = " << kineticEnergy(M, V) << endl; cout << "Potential Energy = " << potentialEnergy(M, H) << endl; return 0; } Output: 
Kinetic Energy = 303.188
Potential Energy = 1266.65
