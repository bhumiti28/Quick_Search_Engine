We are grateful for the great feedback we have received! "This course it great. Easy to follow and the examples show how powerful python can be for the beginner all the way to the advanced. Even if the RPG may not be your cup of tea it shows you the power of classes, for loops, and others!" "Good course even for non-programmers too." "It's really well explained, clear. Not too slow, not too fast." "Very thorough, quick pace. I'm learning A TON! Thank you :)" "Good explanation, nice and easy to understand. Great audio and video quality. I have been trying to get into Python programming for some time; still a long way to go, but so far so good!" We will work on 10 projects, covering the following topics, in this course: Programming Basics Python Fundamentals JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Web Scraping PyMongo (MongoDB) Web Development Django Web Framework Graphical User Interface (GUI) Programming (PyQt) Data Visualization Machine Learning Thank you for taking the time to read this and we hope to see you in the course!
