In this article, we will discuss how we can parse a JSON from a local JSON file. Consider the following Steps. 1. First, we need to store the drag the JSON file from our file system into XCode. We can also create a new file in XCode and save it with extension json, as shown below. Let's add the following JSON in the file. 
{
    "quiz": {
        "sport": {
            "q1": {
                "question": "Which one is correct team name in NBA?",
                "options": [
                    "New York Bulls",
                    "Los Angeles Kings",
                    "Golden State Warriros",
                    "Huston Rocket"
                ],
                "answer": "Huston Rocket"
            }
        },
        "maths": {
            "q1": {
                "question": "5 + 7 = ?",
                "options": [
                    "10",
                    "11",
                    "12",
                    "13"
                ],
                "answer": "12"
            },
            "q2": {
                "question": "12 - 8 = ?",
                "options": [
                    "1",
                    "2",
                    "3",
                    "4"
                ],
                "answer": "4"
            }
        }
    }
}
 2. We need to prepare a model for the above JSON; for this purpose, we need to look into every object of the JSON and decode the same in a separate class. To create a model, create a new file in XCode as QuizResponseModel.swift and place the following code. 
import Foundation


public class QuizResponseModel:Decodable{
    public var quiz : Quiz?
}


public class Quiz:Decodable{
    public var sport : Sport?
    public var maths : Maths?
}
public class Maths : Decodable{
    public var q1 : Question?
    public var q2 : Question?
}


public class Sport : Decodable{
    public var q1 : Question?
}


public class Question : Decodable{
    public var question : String?
    public var options : Array<String>?
    public var answer : String?
}
 3. Now, add the following code in ViewController to parse the SampleJson. 
func parseJSON(_ name: String){
        guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: name, ofType: "txt") else{ return}
        debugPrint(path)
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
        debugPrint(url)
        do{
            let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)
            let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(QuizResponseModel.self, from: data)
            debugPrint(response)
        }catch{
            debugPrint(error)
        }
    }
 Let's see whether we have received some data in our model or not. For this purpose, let's print the questions on the console. Add the following code into viewDidLoad() method. 
for response in (quizResponse.quiz?.sport?.q1?.question!)!{
            debugPrint("Question: \(response)")
        }
 The ViewController.swift contains the following code. 
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    var quizResponse = QuizResponseModel()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
        parseJSON("SampleJSON")
        for response in (quizResponse.quiz?.sport?.q1?.question!)!{
            debugPrint("Question: \(response)")
        }
    }
    func parseJSON(_ name: String){
        guard let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: name, ofType: "txt") else{ return}
        debugPrint(path)
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)
        debugPrint(url)
        do{
            let data = try Data(contentsOf: url)
            let response = try JSONDecoder().decode(QuizResponseModel.self, from: data)
            quizResponse = response
        }catch{
            debugPrint(error)
        }
    }
}
 Reading a JSON file (either local or on the web) is very easy with Swift. Here, we use the decodable protocol to decode the JSON response into our decodable model and use it anywhere in our code.
