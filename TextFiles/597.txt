Examples: Input: S = “sky is blue” Output: sky is blue sky blue is is sky blue is blue sky blue sky is blue is sky Input: S =” Do what you love” Output: Do what you love Do what love you Do you what love Do you love what Do love what you Do love you what what Do you love what Do love you what you Do love what you love Do what love Do you what love you Do you Do what love you Do love what you what Do love you what love Do you love Do what you love what Do love Do what you love Do you what love what Do you love what you Do love you Do what love you what Do Approach: The given problem can be solved using recursion. Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Traverse the sentence and split the words present in the sentence by spaces using split() and store them in a list. Permute the list using built-in python functions itertools.permutations(). Traverse the permutations and convert each permutation to a list. Print these lists. Below is the implementation of the above approach: Python3 # Python implementation of # the above approach from itertools import permutations # Function to generate permutations # of all words in a sentence def calculatePermutations(sentence): # Stores all words in the sentence lis = list(sentence.split()) # Stores all possible permuations # of words in this list permute = permutations(lis) # Iterate over all permutations for i in permute: # Convert the current # permutation into a list permutelist = list(i) # Print the words in the # list separated by spaces for j in permutelist: print(j, end = " ") # Print a new line print() # Driver Code if __name__ == '__main__': sentence = "sky is blue" calculatePermutations(sentence) Output: 
sky is blue 
sky blue is 
is sky blue 
is blue sky 
blue sky is 
blue is sky
