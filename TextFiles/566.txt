Automata Tutorial Theory of automata is a theoretical branch of computer science and mathematical. It is the study of abstract machines and the computation problems that can be solved using these machines. The abstract machine is called the automata. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite automaton. In this tutorial, we are going to learn how to construct deterministic finite automata, non-deterministic finite automata, Regular expression, context-free grammar, context-free language, Push down automata, Turning machines, etc. Prerequisite Before learning Automata, you should have a basic understanding of string, language, alphabets, symbols. Audience Our Automata Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals. Problems We assure that you will not find any problem in this Automata Tutorial.
