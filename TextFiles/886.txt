Examples: Input: S = “mom and dad went to eye hospital” Output: eye and dad went to mom hospital Explanation: All palindromic words present in the string are “mom”, “dad” and “eye“, in the order of their occurrence. Reversing the order of their occurrence generates the sequence {“eye”, “dad”, “mom”}. Therefore, the modified string is “eye and dad went to mom hospital”. Input : S = “wow it is next level” Output: level it is wow. Approach: Follow the steps below to solve the problem: Iterate over the characters of the string S and split the space-separated words from the sentence using split() and store them in a list, say lis. Append all the palindromic words to a new list, say newlist, using append() function. Reverse this new list using reverse() function. Traverse the list lis and keep replacing the palindromic words with the newlist[i] ( initially, i=0 ) and increment i by 1. Print the modified sentence Below is the implementation of the above approach: Python3 # Python implementation of # the above approach # Function to check if a # string S is a palindrome def palindrome(string): if(string == string[::-1]): return True else: return False # Function to print the modified string # after reversing teh order of occurrences # of all palindromic words in the sentence def printReverse(sentence): # Stores the palindromic words newlist = [] # Stores the words in the list lis = list(sentence.split()) # Traversing the list for i in lis: # If current word is a palindrome if(palindrome(i)): # Update newlist newlist.append(i) # Reverse the newlist newlist.reverse() j = 0 # Traverse the list for i in range(len(lis)): # If current word is a palindrome if(palindrome(lis[i])): # Update lis[i] lis[i] = newlist[j] # Increment j j = j + 1 # Print the updated sentence for i in lis: print(i, end =" ") # Driver Code sentence = "mom and dad went to eye hospital" printReverse(sentence) Output: 
eye and dad went to mom hospital
